2. There are interactions with objects such as opening and closing the fridge, opening and closing different drawers, toggling a switch, opening doors, and engaging with a dishwasher.

3. The person also drinks from a cup while standing, swimming, and sitting at different instances.

4. The person performs various activities such as cleaning a table and walking around the premise.

5. There are instances of opening and closing different doors along with walking through them.

6. The person interacts with sensors related to swimming activities quite frequently and intermittently engages in walking and standing as well.

7. Towards the end of the provided sensor labels, the person is seen walking and swimming in intervals.
