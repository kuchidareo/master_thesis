### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to analyze the timestamps and identify the transitions between activities. Let's break down the timestamps and determine the duration for each activity:

1. **Relaxing:** This activity seems to involve sitting or standing, perhaps some walking. Let's analyze the timestamps where the person is sitting, standing, or walking without a specific task like opening/closing drawers or using the dishwasher.

2. **Coffee time:** This activity may involve standing or walking, possibly in conjunction with specific actions like opening/closing drawers or using the dishwasher. We need to look for patterns that suggest a coffee break, such as multiple stand-walk cycles with breaks in between.

3. **Early morning:** This might involve specific tasks related to the beginning of the day, such as opening drawers, cleaning up, or walking around. We should focus on the initial activities recorded in the morning.

4. **Cleanup:** This activity could involve actions like opening/closing drawers or using the dishwasher, combined with walking or standing. We need to identify sequences related to cleaning up.

5. **Sandwich time:** This activity could involve specific interactions with the environment, such as opening drawers or using the dishwasher, followed by a break for making or eating a sandwich. We should look for patterns that suggest a food-related break.

Let's analyze the timestamps further to calculate the duration of each of these activities. If you have additional information or context that could help identify these activities more accurately, please provide it.
