### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity in this CSV, we first need to re-construct the timeline of when each activity occurs. In this case, it appears we have timestamps along with sensor activities that relate to different activities. However, there are no direct labels for activities like "Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", "Cleanup", and "Sandwich time". We have to infer these based on patterns.

Let's try to group the activities that might correspond to these inferred activities based on typical actions:

1. **Relaxing:** This could involve a lot of sitting or standing and might involve minimal walking or actions.
2. **Coffee time:** Typically might involve `Drink from Cup`, `Open Fridge`, and possibly some `Sit` actions.
3. **Early morning:** Could involve a mix of activities like walking, opening drawers, standing, possibly `Open Fridge` or `Drink from Cup`.
4. **Cleanup:** Involves actions like `Close Drawer 2`, `Close Dishwasher`, `Clean Table`.
5. **Sandwich time:** This might involve similar actions to "Coffee time" with a focus on `Open Fridge`, `Sit`, or `Drink from Cup`.

### Analyze the Activities

Without exact labels, we can try to estimate the grouped activities based on actions:

1. **Relaxing:** This might primarily occur when there's no significant kitchen-related activity. Look for periods with mostly `Sit`, `Stand` with minimal other activities.

2. **Coffee time:** Ignores walking but involves `Drink from Cup`. 

3. **Early morning:** Look for a sequence that involves waking up, opening appliances etc. This may involve a series of `Open Fridge`, `Walk`, `Stand`.

4. **Cleanup:** The presence of `Close Drawer 2`, `Close Dishwasher`, `Stand` might involve a grouped cleanup focus.

5. **Sandwich time:** This could be indicated by `Open Fridge`,`Drink from Cup`, `Sit`.

### Task Execution

I'll create a hypothesis based on the few actions available and calculate times. If `Relaxing` can be recognized by 'Sit', `Stand` actions and less transitions, let's group these based on timestamps. 

#### Durations:

1. **Relaxing:**
   - Let's look for `Sit`, `Stand` patterns without other actions.
   
2. **Coffee time:**
   - Likely on timestamps involving `Drink from Cup`, `Sit` together with minimal walking. Groups can be detected where these actions recur.
   
3. **Early morning:**
   - First few actions around starting time possibly grouped actions like `Open Fridge`, `Walk`, `Stand`.
   
4. **Cleanup:**
   - When `Close Drawer 2`, `Clean Table`, `Close Dishwasher` are dominant.
   
5. **Sandwich time:**
    - Similar to `Coffee time` but focused on food preparation possibly inferred by opening fridge and sitting.

Given the CSV data doesn't define their times directly, we interpret durations only by pattern and potential match near-appropriate intervals:

- The sequences are overlapping and implicit.

### Note:

The timestamps recorded as numbers may not enable us to deduce duration accurately just correlate based on re-appearing actions responsible for these undefined activities without additional details.

An exact duration measured in time units (minutes, seconds) can't be discerned solely by the CSV actions alone. Further context on what combinations define each undefined activity should be taken into account traditionally or validated with correct sensor approximation data.

If you have more clear definitions of activity timestamps, I can adjust analysis for precise calculation.
