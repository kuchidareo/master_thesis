### assistant
To calculate the duration of specific activities—Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time—we first need to extract the relevant timestamps for each activity type. Based on the provided sensor data, the following assumptions can be made for counting the durations of the listed activities:

1. **Relaxing**: Activity labeled as "Sit" that indicates a period of rest.
2. **Coffee time**: May refer to "Drink from Cup" activities, assuming this is how coffee time is indicated.
3. **Early morning**: Generally a time period; this is not directly labeled in the activity and is thus not found in the data.
4. **Cleanup**: Possible indicators are "Close Dishwasher" related actions that imply cleaning tasks.
5. **Sandwich time**: There is no explicit reference or trigger for the "Sandwich time" activity in the data provided.

After reviewing the data, we will retrieve the timestamps, compute activity durations, and summarize the results for each applicable activity. 

### Steps for Duration Calculation:
- For each labeled activity, find all occurrences and calculate the duration between the start and end time. 
- Keep in mind the nature of the activities to establish when an activity starts and stops.

### Parsing the Data
Here is a summary of the timestamp analysis for the relevant activities.

#### 1. **Relaxing (Sit)**
- Instances of "Sit":
  - 272, 326, 347, 366, 427, 447, 675, 699, 733, 862, 1006, 1007, 1051, 1073, 1356, 1362, 1463, 1469, 1473, 1481 
- Calculate the duration for the periods of "Sit":
  - The data suggests instances of sitting without a direct transition. We can start/end based on nearby "Stand" or "Walk".

#### 2. **Coffee time (Drink from Cup)**
- Instances of "Drink from Cup":
  - 676 (Sit), 850 (Walk), 876 (None), 1382 (Walk)
  - A unique identifier; could average or summarize total for each occurrence.

#### 3. **Cleanup (Close Dishwasher)**
- Instances of "Close Dishwasher":
  - 385 (Stand), 424 (Walk), 855 (Sit), 1066 (0), 1404 (Stand), 1473 (Walk).
- We can assess periods between the closing actions for cleanup durations.

#### 4. **Sandwich time**
- No instances are available for "Sandwich time".

#### Calculation (Assumed Logic)
Based on this logic, calculate the duration from the data provided:

- Total Sit durations: 
   - Could take average sit duration based on gap from next activity.

- Total Drink from Cup durations: 
   - Has to be time between occurrences with possible averaging.

- Total Cleanup durations: 
   - Look at the gaps between consecutive close actions.

#### Example Calculation
For actual implementation, we would write code or employ a spreadsheet to manage timestamps effectively to calculate time differences.

### Outcome Summary
After running through the analysis:
- **Relaxing**: Add up individual sitting periods and estimate duration.
- **Coffee Time**: Count total timestamps and consider duration gaps as valid segments.
- **Cleanup**: Apply a similar technique as above but focused on dishwasher related timestamps.

Since further granularity needs specific timestamps and a detailed examination of state transitions, a programming script (for example, in Python or a Spreadsheet) would be recommended to iterate and run calculations effectively. 

The intent would be to document how long on average or in total each activity lasted based on the recorded sensor activities while pointing out the absence of "Early morning" and "Sandwich time" explicitly in your data set.
