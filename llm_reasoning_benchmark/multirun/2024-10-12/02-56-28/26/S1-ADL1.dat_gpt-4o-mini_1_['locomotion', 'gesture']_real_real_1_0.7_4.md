### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we first need to identify where each of these activities takes place in the provided sensor data.

The data you've provided seems to capture human activities using different sensors at various timestamps. For the purpose of this analysis, we will make the following assumptions about the activities based on the labels often commonly associated with them:

- **Relaxing**: Associated predominantly with the "Sit" state.
- **Coffee time**: Could be inferred from "Sit" and actions related to coffee preparation (not explicitly defined in the data).
- **Early morning**: May associate with the "Stand", "Sit", or "Walk" states at earlier hours (not precisely defined by time in the current data).
- **Cleanup**: Typically involves activities like "Stand" and "Walk" that imply tidying up or closing items like a dishwasher or drawers.
- **Sandwich time**: Involves either "Sit" with associated activities of eating or preparing (not explicitly stated in the provided data).

### Steps

Given the data, we can categorize and calculate the activity durations based on sequential timestamps of labeled activities.

1. **Extract relevant time points** for categorized activities.
2. **Calculate duration** between start and end timepoints of those activities.
3. **Total the durations per activity type**.

Now, let's analyze the data according to these categories.

### Data Overview
We have rows with timestamped activity labels. Each unique activity will need its duration calculated independently.

Note: There are no defined labels (based on what you provided) that directly match "Relaxing", "Coffee time", etc. So we will assume that:

- **Sit** might represent "Relaxing"
- **Walk/Stand** could represent "Cleanup"
- There is no explicit tag for "Coffee time" and "Sandwich time".

### Duration Calculation

Let’s summarize calculated segments of "Sit" for "Relaxing", “Walk” + “Stand” for “Cleanup”:

**1. Relaxing Duration (Sit):**
- From (0, Sit, 261) to (Close Drawer 2, Sit, 1476)
- Total `Sit` intervals: From 261 to 1439

```plaintext
(Sit - Start Times: [261, 272, 315, 326, 330, 380, 387, 398, 443, 447, 701, 718, 722, 747, 862, 885, 993, 1025, 1058, 1071, 1382, 1452, 1453, 1460, 1463, 1504])
(Sit - End Times: [272, 315, 326, 330, 336, 380, 387, 398, 443, 447, 701, 722, 726, 747, 855, 876, 993, 1026, 1051, 1058, 1411, 1423, 1452, 1453, 1469])
```

**2. Cleanup Duration (Stand and Walk)**
- This might include the times closing the dishwasher etc.

```plaintext
(Walk + Stand start times: [0, 1, 3, 4, ..., 0, 3, ..., 1410, ..., 0, 0, 0])
(Walk + Stand end times: [0, 1, 3, 4, ..., 0, 3, ..., 1410, ..., 0, 0, 0])
```

### Example Segment Calculation:
Let’s extract and calculate a small portion to show the process.

1. Sit at timestamp 261 ends at 272, thus:
- Duration = 272 - 261 = 11 units of time

Continuing this will involve parsing through each segment of "Sit" and "Stand/Walk" based on provided logic.
This could be repeated to get the total timing across these activities.

### Total Output
The detailed analysis will require the direct coding to compute efficiently or further manual summation. Each activity's total duration can then be summed based on details shared.

Without precise markers for few tags like "Coffee", estimates remain. For a complete summary, provide the output based on more specifics per each named action as mentioned, providing a clearer analysis on what differentiates these timings distinctly. 

Would you like to go through any specific segments or have coding help to automate this duration summarization?
