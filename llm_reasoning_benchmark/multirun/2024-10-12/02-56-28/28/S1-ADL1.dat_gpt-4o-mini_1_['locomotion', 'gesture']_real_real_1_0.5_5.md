### assistant
To analyze the activity durations from the provided sensor label data, we need to follow these steps:

1. Extract the timestamps for each activity.
2. Calculate the start and end time for the relevant activities (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, Sandwich time).
3. Compute the duration for each activity by subtracting the start time from the end time.

Here are the timestamps for the mentioned activities (assuming labels are matching):

- **Relaxing**: This could correspond to continuous sitting, typically when no activities like walking or standing are conducted.
- **Coffee time**: This could be identified when there are indications of drinking from a cup.
- **Early morning**: This might typically be early timestamps or specific activities that signify morning (like breakfast).
- **Cleanup**: This is likely related to cupboard and dishwasher activities.
- **Sandwich time**: Similar to coffee time, it could indicate some food preparation or eating actions.

From the provided data, we can look specifically for these activities and their associated timestamps for more concrete analysis. Here's a breakdown approach:

### Step-by-step extraction:
1. **Identify relax actions (sitting)**:
   - Timestamps where `Sit` occurs consecutively without interruptions.

2. **Identify coffee time**:
   - Occurrences of `Drink from Cup`.

3. **Identify cleanup activity**:
   - Occurrences of `Close Dishwasher` and `Close Drawer`.

4. **Identify the sandwich time**:
   - Any activity related to eating (`Drink from Cup` can also serve here).

### The actual calculation;

Letâ€™s summarize the timestamps:
```plaintext
...
Sit, 315
Sit, 362
Sit, 371
Sit, 422
Sit, 447
Sit, 675
Sit, 679
Sit, 699
Sit, 722
...
```

For instance:
- For *Relaxing*: Start from `315` to `719`, where the person is sitting about, indicating relaxation.
- For *Coffee time*: Occurrences of `Drink from Cup` at `443` and `865`.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Collect intervals where an individual was sitting.
2. For Coffee and similar activities, determine effective intervals.

I'll summarize possible activity durations based on analysis below:

### Durations Example:
- **Relaxing**: 
  - Total duration: `Approximately from 315 to 719` = `719 - 315 = 404 seconds`.
  
- **Coffee time**: Repeated instances from sugar timestamps between `443` and `865`.
  - Total duration: `865 - 443 = 422 seconds`.

- **Cleanup**:
  - Identify each span of cleanup actions such as `Close Dishwasher` and calculate.

- **Sandwich time**: Specific timestamps when food being engaged.
  
By calculating the start and end of these activities against the time intervals, we can derive the complete duration statistics.

### Final Output:
- **Relaxing duration**: 404 seconds
- **Coffee time duration**: 422 seconds
- **Early morning**: (Depends on specific early morning activities)
- **Cleanup**: (Based on span of `Close Drawer and Close Dishwasher` actions)
- **Sandwich time**: Calculated as needed; typically around eating durations.

> Note: These computed values need to be validated with correct timestamp associations and filtering out noise activities for accurate representation. 

Please provide any specific details or corrections on the activity definitions so we can narrow our findings.
