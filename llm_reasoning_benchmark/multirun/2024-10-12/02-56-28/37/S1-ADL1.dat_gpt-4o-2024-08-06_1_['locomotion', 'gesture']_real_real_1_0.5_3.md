### assistant
To calculate the duration of each labeled activity, we first need to define the start and end points for each activity based on the timestamps provided. Each activity is signified by a pattern of events that are usually consistent in their sequence.

Since human activities are not explicitly marked with a start and end in this dataset, we need to infer from change points in the data when one activity likely starts and another ends. We can look for patterns in movement or other signals like appliance use that might correlate with specific activities. However, without explicit time segments recorded, we'll need to estimate:

1. **Relaxing:** Possibly when the majority of entries are states like "Sit" or "Lie".
2. **Coffee time:** Could be indicated by "Drink from Cup" events.
3. **Early morning:** This could involve the first set of morning routines, generally characterized by a sequence of different events, potentially starting with "Open Fridge", "Walk", etc.
4. **Cleanup:** Might be associated with numerous "Close Dishwasher", "Close Drawer" sequences, indicating tidying or cleaning up activities.
5. **Sandwich time:** May involve sequences that start with "Open Fridge" and include other activities indicating meal preparation.

### Analysis:

1. **Relaxing:**
   - Look for protracted periods of "Sit" or "Lie" with minimal "Walk".

2. **Coffee time:**
   - Events around times labeled as "Drink from Cup".
   - The timestamps with "Drink from Cup" are 391 and 850, and 1401.

3. **Early morning:**
   - Likely from the outset of early timestamps, involves varied activities.
   - Starting immediately after Timestamp 0 up to perhaps around timestamps 343, based on natural breaks or progressive activity patterns.

4. **Cleanup:**
   - Look for sequences involving "Close Dishwasher" activities or frequent "Walk".

5. **Sandwich time:**
   - Start sequences with "Open Fridge" followed by other preparatory or meal-related activities.
   - "Open Fridge" events occur at timestamp 724, 1314, 1423.

Let's break it down further with adjacency activities:

### Further Analyzing Sensor Patterns:
- **Relaxing:** Can be a prolonged stretch where there are more 'Sit' or 'Lie' within some period.
- **Coffee time:** Shorter sequences near "Drink from Cup" as timestamps such as 850 and 1401 can benchmark such spots. Backtrack slightly to define broader activity if necessary.
- **Cleanup:** Timestamps where multiple close events occur concurrently or recursively frequently around timestamps like 99, 343, through 850.
- **Sandwich time:** Demarked by "Open Fridge", around timestamps like 724, and see if other actions supporting the activity emerge.

### Final Activity Durations
In the absence of specific activity demarcations, the best guess involves:
- **Relaxing:** Assume durations around 1311-1328 based on 'Sit' statuses.
- **Coffee Time:** 391 and shortly post-850 and an event series commencing ~1401.
- **Early Morning:** From the start at 0 up to around 300 (increasing variation of activities indicating beginning-of-day actions).
- **Cleanup:** Numerous sequential "Close Dishwasher", "Close Drawer" around timestamps like 343, can tag cleanup transcending multiple periods.
- **Sandwich Time:** Starts sequences like opening fridge, e.g., timestamp 724 - overlapping with meal preparation actions.

Each activity approximation may need cross-verification against specific behaviors expected for those actions, but the above-informed guess leverages transitions and sequence data heuristically.
