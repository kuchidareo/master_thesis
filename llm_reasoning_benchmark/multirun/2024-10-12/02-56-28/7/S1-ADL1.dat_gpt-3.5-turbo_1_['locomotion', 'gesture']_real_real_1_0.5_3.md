### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to analyze the sensor labels and timestamps. We will look for patterns in the sensor labels to determine the start and end times of each activity.

Unfortunately, the provided data only includes sensor labels and timestamps, without specific labels for the activities mentioned. It seems like the activities have been coded differently in the sensor labels, so we need to make educated guesses based on the sensor labels.

Here is an initial analysis based on the provided data:

1. Stand, Walk, Sit: These labels seem to indicate general movement and stationary activities. It's difficult to directly map them to the specific activities mentioned, but they could potentially represent "Early morning" activities.

2. Open Fridge, Close Dishwasher, Close Drawer: These labels suggest activities related to cleaning up and kitchen tasks, which could correspond to the "Cleanup" activity.

3. Drink from Cup: This label likely corresponds to the "Coffee time" activity.

4. Sandwich time: Unfortunately, there are no direct labels indicating the "Sandwich time" activity in the provided data.

Based on the above analysis, we can make some assumptions:

- "Early morning" activities might be represented by Stand, Walk, Sit labels.
- "Cleanup" activities could be associated with labels like Open Fridge, Close Dishwasher, Close Drawer.
- "Coffee time" is likely represented by the Drink from Cup label.

To provide a more accurate duration for each activity, we would need more specific labels or context on how the activities are represented in the sensor data. If you have additional information or a key mapping sensor labels to activities, please provide it so we can give a more precise calculation of the duration for each activity.
