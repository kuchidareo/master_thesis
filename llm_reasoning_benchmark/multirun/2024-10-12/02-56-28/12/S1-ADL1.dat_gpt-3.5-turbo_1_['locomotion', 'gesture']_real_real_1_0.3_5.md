### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity mentioned (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to analyze the provided sensor data and identify the relevant activities. Given the sensor labels provided in the CSV file, we will categorize the activities based on the labels and timestamps. 

Here is how we can break down the activities and calculate their durations:

1. Relaxing: This activity can be identified with labels like "Sit" and "Stand" where the person is likely relaxing or resting.

2. Coffee time: We can identify this activity based on labels like "Drink from Cup" which indicates the person is having a drink, possibly coffee.

3. Early morning: This activity might involve actions related to opening doors, toggling switches, or general movements at the start of the day.

4. Cleanup: This activity may involve actions like opening/closing drawers, dishwasher, fridge, and general cleaning tasks.

5. Sandwich time: Based on the provided data, there doesn't seem to be a specific label indicating "Sandwich time." We can assume it could be during a "Stand" or "Walk" activity.

By analyzing the sensor labels and timestamps, we can calculate the durations of each of these activities by determining the start and end times of each activity and calculating the difference.

If you have the complete sensor data with timestamps for the mentioned activities, you can follow the steps above to calculate the duration of each activity accurately. Let me know if you need any further assistance or if you have more data to analyze.
