### assistant
To calculate the durations of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we first need to identify the timestamps for each activity from the provided CSV data. However, from the data provided, the specified activities do not appear to be labeled directly. 

### Analyzing the Sensor Data

The sensor labels provided include various actions such as "Walk", "Sit", "Stand", "Close Drawer", and "Close Dishwasher". To analyze the activities accurately, we would need a mapping where recognizable actions correlate with your mentioned activities.

### Reasoning about Activities

Hereâ€™s how we can assume that specific activities might relate to the actions in our dataset:

1. **Relaxing**: May correspond to prolonged "Sit" actions.
2. **Coffee time**: Could correlate with "Drink from Cup" actions or "Sit" actions predominantly within the timeframe associated with coffee consumption.
3. **Early morning**: Could involve "Sit" and "Stand" activities and may appear first in the timeline.
4. **Cleanup**: Likely relates to "Close Dishwasher" and any relevant "Stand" or "Walk" actions around that time.
5. **Sandwich time**: Might also be inferred from "Drink from Cup" and similar actions during potential meal times.

### Calculation of Durations

In order to calculate the durations of activities accurately, we could form an overall structure by tracking each activity's starting and ending timestamps as follows:

1. **Identify the start of each activity**: For instance, if "Sit" actions occur frequently, we capture the first timestamp.
2. **Identify the end of each activity**: This could be a transition to another action.
3. **Calculate the duration**: Subtract the start timestamp from the end timestamp for each identified activity.

### Illustrative Example

To illustrate how you might find the duration for "Sit":
1. Starting timestamp of the first "Sit" instance is `261`.
2. The next relevant action (not a "Sit") can be tracked to determine an ending point.
3. You would continue through the data, collecting and summing the times for the intended activity.

### Conclusion

Without direct labels correlating to the specified types of activities in your CSV input, manual association and calculations depending on the timestamps of relevant sensor actions would be necessary.

If you can provide a more complete mapping or specific timestamps for your activities labeled, we could calculate them accurately. If you have an additional structure or subtype of activity detection in mind, please share, and I'll refine the calculations further!
