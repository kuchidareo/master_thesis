### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we must identify the time intervals during which each activity occurs based on the sensor labels or patterns resembling these activities. Unfortunately, the CSV data you provided does not contain explicit labels for each of these activities. Therefore, we'll need to make assumptions based on common interpretations of activity patterns and sensor data.

Here are some assumptions we might make:
- **Relaxing**: May be associated with "Sit" or "Lie" activities.
- **Coffee time**: Could be associated with "Walk", "Stand", followed by "Sit" in a kitchen context.
- **Early morning**: A lengthy period of activity in the morning (including "Walk" and "Stand").
- **Cleanup**: Activities often involve "Walk", "Stand", and operation of drawers and dishwashers.
- **Sandwich time**: Similar to Coffee time but may include more "Stand" and "Open Drawer/Dishwasher" activities.

Based on these assumptions, let's analyze the CSV data:

1. **Relaxing**: Periods with multiple consecutive "Sit" or occasional "Lie" activities.
2. **Coffee time**: Short periods of kitchen-related activities (e.g., opening drawer/dishwasher) followed by sitting down for a short while.
3. **Early morning**: Typically a sequence of active events (e.g., "Walk", "Stand") beginning early in the data.
4. **Cleanup**: Often involves drawer/dishwasher operations with "Walk" and "Stand".
5. **Sandwich time**: Recognized by increased drawer operations followed by "Stand"/"Sit".

Next, let's extract and sum the durations based on these patterns for each activity:

- **Relaxing**: 
  - Recognize continuous "Sit" and combine their timestamps: 
    - 0, Sit, 261 to 0, Stand, 355: Duration = 355 - 261 = 94
    - 0, Sit, 671 to 0, Walk, 675: Duration = 675 - 671 = 4
    - 0, Sit, 896 to 0, Walk, 900: Duration = 900 - 896 = 4
    - 0, Sit, 1007 to 0, Stand, 1010: Duration = 1010 - 1007 = 3 
    - 0, Sit, 1448 to 0, Walk, 1452: Duration = 1452 - 1448 = 4
  - Total Relaxing time = 94 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 108 seconds

- **Coffee time**: Short periods with a mix of preparing ("Open Drawer/Dishwasher"), then sitting.
  - There are no explicit coordinates for this, but based on the assumption and the patterns like:
    - A pattern (e.g., Walk, Open Drawer/Dishwasher, Sit) could be considered around: 706-711, 1473-1476
    - There seem to be few instances corresponding to this pattern)

- **Early morning**: 
  - Imagine this is where activity starts and early action might be a mix of activities.
  - If the start of action is initiated at 0, let's consider activity till some quiet/sit:
    - 0, Walk up to, Sit with: not strictly defined but more active in a continuous block.

- **Cleanup**: 
  - Often involves drawer/dishwasher operations with "Walk" and "Stand".
  - Observe clusters of these actions; states where "Open Drawer/Dishwasher":
    - Sequences with "Close Drawer 2" from timestamps like 336 to 109 or others.

- **Sandwich time**: Again pattern driven by drawer and possibly, walk/stand:
  - Quite like coffee time and can differentiate based on action patterns within a shorter span, given like:
    - Examples seen with 0,_walk, and operation of equipment.
  
Since activities are contextual and not distinctly marked, further detailed pattern analysis with domain knowledge of task occurrence or explicitly marked data would be necessary for accurate calculations.
