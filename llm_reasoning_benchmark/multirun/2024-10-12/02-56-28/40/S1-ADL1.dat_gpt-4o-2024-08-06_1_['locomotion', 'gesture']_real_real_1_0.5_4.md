### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to analyze the timestamps provided and deduce what activities occurred based on the given labels.

1. **Identify relevant activity segments:**
   - We need to determine which timestamps correspond to the activities mentioned.
   - Unfortunately, the provided data doesn't label activities like "Relaxing", "Coffee time", etc., directly. Therefore, we must infer them based on the context or additional hints (like specific actions or movement patterns).

2. **Calculate the duration of each inferred activity:**
   - Check the presence of specific patterns or repeated actions that might suggest a specific activity.
   - Sum up the durations in those segments.

**Analysis:**

Given the data, the labels correspond to various specific actions, but not directly to the named activities. I'll go ahead and make some assumptions for analysis:

- **Relaxing:** Often associated with "Sit", "Lie", or "None" labels.
- **Coffee time:** Could involve short sequence of activities, often involving "Stand", "Sit", "Walk" and perhaps "Drink from Cup".
- **Early morning:** This could be inferred from the first set of actions listed. Often involves "Stand", "Walk", "Sit".
- **Cleanup:** Involves actions like "Close Drawer", "Close Door", "Walk", "Stand".
- **Sandwich time:** Likely involves short movements around the kitchen, standing and possibly the action "Drink from Cup".

**Let's infer some phases:**

1. **Relaxing:**
   - Segments with "Sit", "Lie", or "None" with no significant interaction around:
     - e.g., Timestamps 0 to 92, 675 to 947, etc.

2. **Coffee time:**
   - Observe shorter activities possibly involving "Drink from Cup": Timestamps like 394, 679 show consumption actions.

3. **Early morning:**
   - Initial movements: 92 to ~385 could reflect this period.

4. **Cleanup:**
   - Periods with multiple object interactions, such as repeated "Close Drawer" actions: e.g., 336 to 704, 993 to 1066, etc.

5. **Sandwich time:**
   - Involves a sequence of small movements that could involve fetching and returning items. Could overlap with coffee or cleanup.

**Final step: Time calculations**

- Sum the durations within the time ranges for each activity.
- Note any overlaps among activities where you might need to attribute time to the primary activity or split duration.

Since the data does not outright tell us when each specific task starts/stops without extra context, we should refine the strategy as patterns become clear.

For accurate absolute calculations, further context or detailed event descriptions might be required.
