### assistant
To calculate the duration of each labeled activity from the provided CSV file, we'll first identify timestamps associated with the start and end of each activity. The labels are: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time. However, we don't have direct labels in the dataset for these activities but rather individual actions with timestamps.

To proceed, we can infer the activities based on the sequence of actions. I'll begin with a hypothetical classification of actions into potential activities and derive their durations using the timestamps. We'll focus on similar patterns or repeated labels:

1. **Relaxing:** May involve transitions to `Sit` or `Stand` with long durations of `None` in between.

2. **Coffee time:** Might involve `Drink from Cup` actions combined with `Stand` and `Walk` around kitchen-related actions (e.g., Open/Close Fridge).

3. **Early morning:** Could be a sequence in the initial timestamps when transitioning from `None` to active states.

4. **Cleanup:** Likely includes actions like `Close Drawer`, `Close Dishwasher`, and possibly `Stand` or `Walk` between these actions.

5. **Sandwich time:** May involve `Open Fridge`, `Walk`, and other stand-sit transitions.

For analysis, let's extract and calculate possible durations:

- **Find Sections of Interest:** Identify start and end timestamps where a sequence of actions indicates any activity.

### Inferred Activity Durations:

1. **Coffee time:**
   - Notable activity involving `Drink from Cup` starts around timestamp 436 and very likely involves previous Stand/Walk actions as part of preparation for coffee, with subsequent `Walk/Sit/Stand` actions showing a conclusion of drinking coffee.

   - **Duration estimation around timestamps:**
     - Start: Begin from just before `Drink from Cup`, around 428 to 436.
     - End: Around 447, we see activities potentially ending with `Sit`.

2. **Early morning:**
   - Often begins with Sit/Stand indicating morning routines, around the opening sequences.

   - **Duration estimation:**
     - Start: Early timestamps 0 to 261 involve `Stand` and `Walk`, suggesting waking up periods.
     - Conclude by observing transition from Wake (`None`, `Stand`) to more active states.

3. **Cleanup:**
   - Characterized by sequences like `Close Drawer`, possibly from timestamp 336 to 900.
   - Intermittent with other actions but focus on closing actions especially fraught around Drawers and Dishwasher.

4. **Sandwich time:**
   - Look for actions like `Open Fridge`, `Stand`, `Walk`.

   - **Duration estimation:**
     - Notable around continuous transitions from 1365 to approximately 1504.
     - Actions include making or preparing with sequence like `Walk`, switching between `Stand` and Sit.

5. **Relaxing:**
   - Long durations where activity changes between `Sit` and `Stand` or `None` denote rest periods.

   - **Duration estimation:**
     - Relaxing could appear near timestamps where the person remains mostly `Sit` or `None`, like around 992 to 1039.

### Conclusion:
By observing transitions between specific states combined with timing, activity periods can be gauged even without explicit labeling. These timeframes offer an inferred breakdown of potential activities based on available data. Each activity should have a comprehensive flow of start and end but these are approximations. For precise calculation, activities should ideally be labeled directly within the dataset.
