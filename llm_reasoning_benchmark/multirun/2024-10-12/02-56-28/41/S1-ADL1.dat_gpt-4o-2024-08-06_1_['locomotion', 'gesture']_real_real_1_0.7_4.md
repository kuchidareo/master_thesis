To calculate the duration of each activity: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time, we need to analyze which sequences of actions correspond to each activity. The labels given in the data do not directly map to those activities, so we need to interpret possible mappings based on a typical daily routine or assumptions.

Let's attempt to make educated guesses:

1. **Relaxing** may involve sequences where the person is mostly sitting or standing at length without many walking actions between these states. However, given the context, it isn't straightforward to determine without additional information.

2. **Coffee time** is often associated with brief, repeated actions in a short period, possibly characterized by actions involving "Close Drawer" which might indicate accessing a drawer for coffee making. 

3. **Early morning** might be represented by a sequence of getting up (stand), perhaps followed by walking and other morning activities like closing drawers or cupboards (which might be used for breakfast tasks).

4. **Cleanup** could involve a sequence with actions like "Close Dishwasher," "Close Drawer," and much walking and standing which are indicative of cleaning tasks.

5. **Sandwich time** likely includes actions with "Close Drawer" interspersed with sitting, standing, and perhaps walking, suggesting preparing food.

Next, let's assign possible sequences to these activities. This is speculative and meant to demonstrate potential mappings. Actual mappings require domain expertise or additional context on how sensors are labeled during those activities.

For simplicity, we will:
- Assume that "Close Dishwasher" and repeated "Close Drawer" actions can often indicate Cleanup
- "Close Drawer" followed by sitting or standing may indicate Sandwich time
- "Close Drawer" with frequent movements might indicate Coffee time

Let's attempt to consolidate the sequences: 

- **Relaxing:** Look for long periods primarily of Sitting/Standing without significant walking or drawer/dishwasher activity.
- **Coffee time:** Series of rapid changes, especially Drawer actions that don't match cleanup.
- **Early morning:** Any Sitting and preparing (Drawer and Stand actions) right after getting up.
- **Cleanup:** Series of Drawer and Dishwasher with Walking or Standing.
- **Sandwich time:** Drawer and Sit sequence but often with Walking or Stand action. 

Now let's manually try to map these and calculate approximate durations based on timestamps:

Unfortunately, without explicit markers, this is largely a manual perceptual task and based on speculative matching. We would calculate the duration by subtracting the start time of new context activity from the last recorded timestamp of the previous activity context.

For illustration:
- Calculate the start and end timestamps of continuous similar contexts to give us an idea about possible duration of each speculative activity context.

### Example Manual Calculation (Potential Mapping):

**Activity Mappings:**
- **Relaxing (Tentative):** Find blocks of continuous sitting or minimal movement, e.g., around `1031` to `1335`.
- **Coffee time (Tentative):** Look for clusters of Drawer activity, like around `336` to `371`.
- **Early morning (Tentative):** Early part of the sequence, starting right after the first Walking and Sitting sequence `0` to `93`.
- **Cleanup (Tentative):** Intense sequence of combinations, around `1311` to `1476`.
- **Sandwich time (Tentative):** Possibly `850` to `909`, actions mostly suggest preparatory phase, based on Drawer and Sit with intermittent Walking.

### Duration Calculation Example:
We would read each range we associate with a particular activity and compute the difference between the latest and earliest timestamps within that range to estimate how long that activity lasted. Given that the durations are uncertain due to speculative assignment, this approach highlights the need for a more robust method based on domain-specific sensor labels and definitions for proper calculation.
