### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity mentioned: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time, we need to analyze the sensor labels and timestamps provided in the CSV file. 

Since the activities are not directly labeled in the data, we can make assumptions based on the sensor labels and timestamps to estimate the duration of each activity. Here are the potential assumptions based on the provided data:

1. Relaxing: This activity can be assumed during periods where there is a combination of sitting, standing, and no movement (none). The duration can be calculated by summing up the time intervals where these sensor labels are observed.

2. Coffee time: Coffee time can be assumed during periods where there is a specific action related to coffee drinking. In the provided data, the label "Drink from Cup" is associated with this activity.

3. Early morning: Since the exact time range for "Early morning" is not specified in the data, we can consider this to be a general activity that might occur at the beginning of the recorded timeline.

4. Cleanup: Cleanup activity can be inferred from the sensor labels such as "Close Drawer" and "Close Dishwasher". The duration can be estimated based on the occurrences of these labels.

5. Sandwich time: Similar to "Coffee time", we can assume the "Sandwich time" activity based on specific actions related to eating a sandwich. However, this specific label is not present in the data provided.

By analyzing the timestamps and sensor labels, you can calculate the duration of each activity based on the assumptions made above. Let me know if you need further assistance in calculating the durations for each activity.
