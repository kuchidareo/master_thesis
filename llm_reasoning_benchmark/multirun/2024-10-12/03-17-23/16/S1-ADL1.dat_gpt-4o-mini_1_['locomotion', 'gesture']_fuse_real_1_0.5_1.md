### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we will first identify the timestamps corresponding to each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), and then compute the total duration for each activity by finding the difference between the start and end timestamps.

Here are the relevant activities identified in the dataset:

1. **Cleanup** - This activity appears to correspond to entries labeled as "Clean Table."
2. **Sandwich time** - This activity was not explicitly mentioned in the provided data, hence we will assume there are no entries.
3. **Coffee time** - This activity was not explicitly mentioned in the provided data, hence we will assume there are no entries.
4. **Early morning** - This activity was not explicitly mentioned in the provided data, hence we will assume there are no entries.
5. **Relaxing** - This activity was not explicitly mentioned in the provided data, hence we will assume there are no entries.

**Data Analysis:**

From the data, the only identifiable activity is "Clean Table." There are two entries for this activity:

- **Entry 1**: `Clean Table,Swim,1440`
- **Entry 2**: `Clean Table,Swim,1451`

To find the total duration for the "Cleanup" activity, we can simply take the timestamp of the end of the activity minus the start of the activity:

- Start timestamp: 1440
- End timestamp: 1451

**Calculation for Cleanup:**
```
Duration (Cleanup) = End timestamp - Start timestamp
Duration (Cleanup) = 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds
```

**Summary of Calculated Durations:**
- **Relaxing**: 0 seconds (no entries)
- **Coffee time**: 0 seconds (no entries)
- **Early morning**: 0 seconds (no entries)
- **Cleanup**: 11 seconds
- **Sandwich time**: 0 seconds (no entries)

Thus, the only timed activity in the provided dataset corresponds to "Cleanup" with a total duration of 11 seconds. All other activities listed have no entries based on the data given.
