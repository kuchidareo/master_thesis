### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity based on the provided timestamps and labels, we can follow a few steps. Here’s how to approach it:

1. **Extract unique activities**: First, identify the unique activities that you want to monitor (in this case, Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time).

2. **Calculate durations**: For each activity, calculate the duration by finding the difference in timestamps for consecutive entries of that activity.

3. **Summing durations**: Sum these differences to get the total duration for each activity.

Given the provided data, we don't have explicit labels for "Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", and "Sandwich time". However, we do see an instance of "Cleanup" and "Sandwich time" (which is represented by "Drink from Cup") in the activities.

### Step-by-step Calculation Process

1. **Identify and isolate relevant activity entries**.
2. **Calculate start and end times** for each relevant activity.
3. **Sum durations for each activity**.

### Relevant Activity Labels
- **Cleanup** is represented by "Clean Table".
- **Sandwich time** can be represented by entries that include "Drink from Cup".

Now, let’s extract these timestamps from the dataset.

### Cleanup (Clean Table) Duration Calculation
- **Start timestamp for "Clean Table"**: t=1440
- **End timestamp for 1st "Clean Table" instance**: t=1451
- **Duration** = 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds

We have another "Clean Table" entry at t=1451 (start) and t=1451 (end): this doesn’t count as a duration. So the total duration for Cleanup is 11 seconds.

### Sandwich Time (Drink from Cup) Calculation
1. First **Drink from Cup** entry:
   - Start timestamp: t=843
   - End timestamp: t=851
   - Duration = 851 - 843 = 8 seconds

2. Second **Drink from Cup** entry:
   - Start timestamp: t=865
   - End timestamp: t=877 (not provided but inferred as the next time).
   - For the provided data, the last entry is t=890 so capturing until next transition, not specific for Sandwich duration thus ignore as it's not conclusive.

So, the only conclusive duration we can gather is from the first entry of "Drink from Cup".

### Summary of Durations
- Cleanup (Clean Table) Duration: **11 seconds**
- Sandwich time (Drink from Cup) Duration: **8 seconds**
  
For the remaining activities (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning), we do not have sufficient data based on the provided sensor logs.

### Conclusion
Based on our analysis:
- **Cleanup** has a total duration of 11 seconds.
- **Sandwich timing** (represented by "Drink from Cup") has a total duration of 8 seconds. 

The activities "Relaxing" and "Coffee time" do not appear in the dataset provided, so we cannot assess their durations.
