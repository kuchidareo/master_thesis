### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we can look at the timestamps for the start and end of each activity for the specified activities: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time. By analyzing the data in the CSV file, we can determine the duration of each activity based on the timestamps provided.

However, the data provided in the CSV file does not contain clear labels or timestamps for the activities mentioned. It seems to have sensor readings and activity labels like standing, walking, swimming, etc. 

To accurately calculate the duration of each specific activity, we would need additional information or a different format of data that clearly indicates when each activity starts and ends.

If you have the correct data format or additional information, please provide it so that I can assist you in calculating the duration of each activity.
