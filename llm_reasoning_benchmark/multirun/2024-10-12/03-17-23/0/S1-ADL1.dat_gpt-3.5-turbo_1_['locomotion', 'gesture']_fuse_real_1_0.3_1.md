### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we need to look at the timestamps where each activity starts and ends. By analyzing the provided data, we can identify the relevant timestamps for each activity and calculate the duration.

Here are the timestamps for the activities mentioned in the CSV file:

- Relaxing: Stand at timestamp 336 and Stand at timestamp 843
- Coffee time: Drink from Cup at timestamp 843 and Stand at timestamp 907
- Early morning: Open Fridge at timestamp 907 and Swim at timestamp 673
- Cleanup: Clean Table at timestamp 1440 and Stand at timestamp 1476
- Sandwich time: Close Door 2 at timestamp 1476 and Swim at timestamp 1522

Now, we can calculate the duration of each activity by subtracting the start timestamp from the end timestamp.

- Relaxing: 843 - 336 = 507
- Coffee time: 907 - 843 = 64
- Early morning: 673 - 907 = -234 (Negative value may indicate a mistake in the data)
- Cleanup: 1476 - 1440 = 36
- Sandwich time: 1522 - 1476 = 46

Please note that the negative duration for the "Early morning" activity suggests that there might be an error in the timestamps or labels provided in the data. It would be best to double-check the data for accuracy and consistency to ensure the correct analysis.
