### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity labeled as "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," and "Sandwich time," we will follow these steps:

1. **Extract Timestamps**: Read the provided data and extract the timestamps for the listed activities.
2. **Calculate Duration**: For each unique activity, calculate the difference between the end and start timestamps.
3. **Summarize Results**: Provide the total duration for each activity.

Given the data provided, it seems that there are no labels for the specified activities ("Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," and "Sandwich time"). 

Let's perform an analysis of the activities present in the provided CSV data:

- **Activities Noted**: The labels observed include "Stand," "Swim," "Walk," "Shake Hands," "Open Fridge," "Close Drawer," and "Close Door" among others. These do not match the specified activities.
- **No Relevant Data**: Since there are no entries for the specified activity labels, we cannot calculate the duration for "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," or "Sandwich time."

If you need a summary of the existing activities and their durations, please confirm, or specify if there is any other set of activities you would like to analyze.
