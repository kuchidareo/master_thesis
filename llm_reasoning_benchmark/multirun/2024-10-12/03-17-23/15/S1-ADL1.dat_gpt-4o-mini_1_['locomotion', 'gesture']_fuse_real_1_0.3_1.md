### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) from the provided CSV content, we first need to identify and extract the relevant rows for each activity, then compute the time spent on each one based on the timestamps given. However, from the visible data, these specific activities do not appear to be labeled directly.

Hereâ€™s how you would generally approach this, assuming we had the relevant labels:

1. **Activity Detection**: Identify which entries correspond to the activities of interest.
2. **Time Calculation**: For each detected entry, calculate the duration by subtracting the starting timestamp from the ending timestamp.
3. **Summation**: Aggregate the durations for that specific activity.

Since the provided data lacks explicit labels for "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," and "Sandwich time," we need clarification or further data where these activities have been annotated.

Assuming you could provide a mapping of activities to the given labels, the analysis would proceed as follows:

### Sample Calculation (Hypothetical Example)

If we had activities labeled directly in the data like this:
```
0,Relaxing,10
0,Relaxing,30
0,Coffee time,50
0,Coffee time,70
```

1. **Extract Relaxing Activity**:
   - Start: 10
   - End: 30
   - Duration = End - Start = 20

2. **Extract Coffee Time Activity**:
   - Start: 50
   - End: 70
   - Duration = End - Start = 20

3. **Summation**:
   - Total Relaxing Duration: 20
   - Total Coffee Time Duration: 20

If you have a key or further information on how activities are represented, please provide that, and we can perform accurate calculations on the data!
