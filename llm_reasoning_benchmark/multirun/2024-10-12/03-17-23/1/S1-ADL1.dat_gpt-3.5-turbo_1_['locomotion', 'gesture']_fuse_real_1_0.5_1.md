To calculate the duration of each activity mentioned in the CSV file, we need to look at the timestamps where each activity starts and ends. By calculating the time elapsed between these timestamps, we can determine the duration of each activity. 

Here are the activities mentioned in the file along with the corresponding timestamps where they start and end:

1. Relaxing:
   - Start: Open Fridge, Stand, 336
   - End: Shake Hands, Swim, 447
   - Duration: 447 - 336 = 111 seconds

2. Coffee time:
   - Start: Open Fridge, Stand, 907
   - End: Shake Hands, Swim, 1326
   - Duration: 1326 - 907 = 419 seconds

3. Early morning:
   - Start: Open Fridge, Walk, 1313
   - End: Shake Hands, Swim, 1382
   - Duration: 1382 - 1313 = 69 seconds

4. Cleanup:
   - Start: Clean Table, Stand, 1440
   - End: Clean Table, Swim, 1451
   - Duration: 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds

5. Sandwich time:
   - Start: Clean Table, Swim, 1451
   - End: Shake Hands, Stand, 1469
   - Duration: 1469 - 1451 = 18 seconds

Therefore, the durations of the activities are as follows:
- Relaxing: 111 seconds
- Coffee time: 419 seconds
- Early morning: 69 seconds
- Cleanup: 11 seconds
- Sandwich time: 18 seconds
