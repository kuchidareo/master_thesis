### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) based on the provided sensor data, we can first identify any occurrences of those activities and the associated timestamps.

However, from the given data, it appears that the specific activities of interest (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) do not directly appear in the provided sensor logs.

### Procedure for Calculation
1. **Identify Timestamps for Each Activity**: Review the list of recorded activities to ascertain if relevant activities were captured in the provided CSV.
2. **Calculate Duration**: If matching activities are found, compute their durations as follows:
    - For each identified activity, take the timestamps of the start and end for that distinct activity.
    - Duration = End timestamp - Start timestamp.
3. **Summarize**: Total the durations for each activity where applicable.

### Analysis of Given Activities
Going through the provided data:
- The entries related to the specified activities do not exist. Activities like "Swim," "Stand," "Walk," "Shake Hands," and "Open Fridge" appear much more frequently.
- The only activity that can somewhat align with the mention of “Cleanup” is **Clean Table** which appears in two instances. 

### Calculation for "Clean Table"
1. **Timestamps for "Clean Table"**:
   - First occurrence: 1440 to 1451 → Duration = 1451 - 1440 = 11
   - Second occurrence: 1451 to 1451 → Duration = 1451 - 1451 = 0

**Total Duration for Clean Table**: 
- 11 seconds from the first occurrence.

### Conclusion
The only identifiable activity from the request is "Clean Table" with a total active duration of `11 seconds`. The other activities of "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," and "Sandwich time" were not mentioned in the data, so their durations cannot be calculated. 

If you have further adjustments or specific requests related to other activities or additional data, please let me know!
