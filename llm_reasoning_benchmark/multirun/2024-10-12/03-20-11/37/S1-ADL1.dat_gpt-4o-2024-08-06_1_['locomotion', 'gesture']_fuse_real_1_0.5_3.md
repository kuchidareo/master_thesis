### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity such as Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time, we must first identify the segments of timestamps linked to these activities. Unfortunately, the CSV does not label specific activities directly but seems to contain sensor readings and other unrelated activities like swimming, standing, and walking. Assuming the CSV has time-ordered entries with a numeric timestamp representing time since a specific point (perhaps seconds since the first recorded event), we can infer the duration of each activity.

Since specific labels are missing for each activity, let's attempt to determine an approximate time based on common activity markers. Sometimes sensor activity or combination of activities (like "Close Fridge" and "Drink from Cup") can indicate specific actions. However, these assumptions must come from prior knowledge about how the activities align with sensor markers:

1. **Relaxing** - Often associated with standing or sitting for extended periods without significant walking/swimming.
2. **Coffee Time** - Could queue in with "Drink from Cup", fridge activities, or minimal movement shortly after these markers.
3. **Early Morning** - This time may be associated with "Open Door" or "Open Fridge", signifying morning routines.
4. **Cleanup** - Often involves significant moving around, interacting with areas such as Dishwashers, Doors, or Cleanup itself.
5. **Sandwich Time** - Could involve a sequence like opening a fridge or drawer, followed by drinking or reducing activity.

Here's a high-level estimation approach using the available data:

### Estimating Activities:
1. **Relaxing:** Calculate intervals with minimal activity changes.
2. **Coffee Time:** Look for timestamps around "Drink from Cup" and no significant other activities.
3. **Early Morning:** Use initial timestamps since no `am` or `pm` division; determine times with more setup activities.
4. **Cleanup:** Associated with actions having significant movement like "Clean Table", "Open/Close Dishwasher", regular Walks.
5. **Sandwich Time:** When a combination includes "Open Fridge" and then "Close Drawer", it's likely related to food activity.

#### Analysis:

- **Relaxing:** 
  An example relaxation interval might be `0,Stand,973` till `0,Walk,1037` due to low variations in standing/walking.
  
- **Coffee Time:** 
  Occurs likely around `Drink from Cup,Swim,851`, assuming a relaxing/constant stance without swift movements.
  
- **Early Morning:**
  Based on early opening activities, such as `Open Door 1,Swim,366`, engage in standard walking/standing activities when waking up.

- **Cleanup:**
  Identified within active intervals, similar to segments starting or switching frequently, such as `Clean Table,0,1451`.

- **Sandwich Time:**
  Followed initially by `Open Fridge,Walk,723` progression to preparing/eating â€“ several standing intervals.

### Calculation Results:
The CSV file does not clearly map labeled activities to explicit timestamps due to limited metadata. Still, it lays ground for defining certain plausible blocks using key cues above for speculation/approximation in analysis contexts. Verify actual results only by having exact labeled events/timing data, which is missing from this dataset.
