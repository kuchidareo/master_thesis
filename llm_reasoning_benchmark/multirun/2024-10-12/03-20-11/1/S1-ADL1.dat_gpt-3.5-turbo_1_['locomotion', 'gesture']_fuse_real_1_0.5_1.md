### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we need to find the start and end timestamps for each activity and then calculate the duration.

Here are the start and end timestamps for each activity:
- Relaxing (Stand): Start at timestamp 330, end at timestamp 733 (403 seconds)
- Coffee Time (Drink from Cup): Start at timestamp 843, end at timestamp 855 (12 seconds)
- Early Morning (Open Fridge): Start at timestamp 723, end at timestamp 1049 (326 seconds)
- Cleanup (Clean Table): Start at timestamp 1440, end at timestamp 1469 (29 seconds)
- Sandwich Time (Close Drawer 3): Start at timestamp 1071, end at timestamp 1402 (331 seconds)

Therefore, the duration of each activity is as follows:
- Relaxing: 403 seconds
- Coffee Time: 12 seconds
- Early Morning: 326 seconds
- Cleanup: 29 seconds
- Sandwich Time: 331 seconds
