### assistant
To calculate the duration of specified activities based on the sensor data provided, we need to identify the start and end times for each activity label: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time. 

Since the data provided does not include these activity labels directly, we can infer their durations from the context of the activities and the tags if present. However, since no data for these specific activities has been provided in the input, we have to focus on those activities that we can identify.

From the log, we can deduce the following activities based on labels observed:

1. **Cleanup**: This corresponds to instances where "Clean Table" is recorded.
2. **Sandwich Time**: There are no relevant events logged that clearly state "Sandwich time" or equivalent actions.
3. **Coffee Time**: There are no events logged that pertain to "Coffee time."
4. **Relaxing**: This typically might align with activities like "Stand" or "Swim" at various points, but there is no explicit mention either.
5. **Early Morning**: No explicit mention or actions indicate "Early morning."

Since there is only the "Cleanup" activity label visible, we can calculate the duration for this one activity.

### Cleanup Activity Durations:
The activity labeled as "Clean Table" appears three times with the following timestamps:

1. **Start:** 1440 (at `Stand`)
2. **End:** 1451 (at `0` and `Swim`)

### Calculating Duration:
- Duration of Cleanup = End time - Start time = 1451 - 1440 = **11 seconds**.

In conclusion, based on the log provided, the only activity we can confirm is Cleanup with a duration of 11 seconds. The other specified activities (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, and Sandwich time) do not appear to be recorded in the dataset given for analysis.
