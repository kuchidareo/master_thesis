### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity ("Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," and "Sandwich time"), we first need to identify the timestamps of each activity and then compute the difference between the start and end times for each. However, the provided data doesn’t explicitly include these activity labels. We will work under the assumption that we must identify and calculate durations based on common patterns.

### Table Overview:
The table contains timestamps from sensors along with actions like swimming, walking, standing, etc. Based on the activity labels you provided, I will use reasonable assumptions to identify potential sections of time for those activities.

### Analysis
- **Relaxing** could be represented by several '0, Stand' entries as it often indicates a stationary activity without much interaction.
  
- **Coffee time** might include periods right after 'Drink from Cup' labels. 

- **Early morning** might not be explicitly represented but could be inferred from the early timestamps before major activities.

- **Cleanup** will be associated with labels like 'Clean Table'.

- **Sandwich time** would typically follow activities like 'Drink from Cup', assuming people may have a sandwich during this time.

Let's assume we extract the approximate range of timestamps for each of these activities based on the available data. 

### Estimated Durations
1. **Relaxing:** 
   - Captured under '0, Stand'.
   - Example intervals: 
     - 0, Stand, 0 to 0, Stand, 359
     - 0, Stand, 673 to 0, Stand, 721
   - Each continuous segment can be summed.

2. **Coffee time:** 
   - Identified with 'Drink from Cup'.
   - Captured timestamps include:
     - Start at 843, end at 876
   - Then count intervals accordingly.

3. **Early morning:**
   - Use early timestamps until a substantial engagement begins, let's say until the first 'Open Fridge' which occurs at 907.

4. **Cleanup:**
   - Directly associated with 'Clean Table' program.
   - Example: 
     - 'Clean Table' from 1440 to 1451 gives us a duration.

5. **Sandwich time:**
   - Anything in conjunction with drinking labeled timestamps.

### Calculation (Hypothetical Example)
Without exact timestamps for each specific activity, here is a general calculation method based on assumed start and stop points.

Assuming we made the following observations:

- **Relaxing:** 
   - From 0 to 359, 673 to 721 would give many values, let's say on review, it comes out to roughly 200 minutes.

- **Coffee time:** 
   - From 843 to 876 would be roughly 33 minutes.

- **Early morning:** 
   - Assuming till Open Fridge (907), may give roughly 900 minutes from the start.

- **Cleanup:** 
   - 1440 to 1451 gives us 11 minutes.

- **Sandwich time:** 
   - As previously inferred through closely placed drink statistics (let’s say around 850).

In order to accurately provide specific values for each activity some real time stamps need to be reviewed. The summary checks for endpoints need precise sensor logs for better results since the labels apply to overlaps and interpretations may vary.

In reality, this requires a careful look at the structure and methodology of labeling with other set assumptions.
Please provide example segments of the timestamps that correlate more directly with the intended activities if available.
