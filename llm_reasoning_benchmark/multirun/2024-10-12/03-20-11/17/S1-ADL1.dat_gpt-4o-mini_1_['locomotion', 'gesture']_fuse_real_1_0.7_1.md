### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) from the given data, we will first summarize the relevant parts of the data provided. 

### Step 1: Extract the relevant activities from the dataset

From the provided CSV data, there are no direct mentions of "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," or "Sandwich time." Most activities are related to "Swim," "Stand," "Shake Hands," "Walk," and "Drink from Cup." For our analysis, we will focus on calculating durations for any activities listed.

### Step 2: Identify the occurrences of any known activity and their durations

However, for the purpose of demonstrating how to compute the durations for activities, let's assume you have some defined activities that would be identifiable. Here's how one would generally calculate the duration of an activity using timestamps within a dataset.

1. **Timestamps Extraction**: You would parse through the data to record the start and end times of each activity.
2. **Duration Calculation**: Subtract the start timestamp from the end timestamp for each occurrence of an activity.

### Example Calculation Method

1. **Extracting Data**: For example, if we had identified activities:
   - Swim: starts at 92 seconds and gets recorded until 1504 seconds.
   
   The relevant pairs might look like this:
   - **Start** at time 92: Swim.
   - **End** time for the last Swim at 1522: 

   Since "Swim" is the only activity provided and involved multiple timestamps, we could calculate the duration as:
   - Total Active Time = Last timestamp for "Swim" - First timestamp for "Swim".
   
   If you had an activity denoted as "Sandwich time" and it occurred at different points, youâ€™d do similar for each start-end identification. 

2. **Summation of Durations**: Each identified occurrence would accumulate its duration.

### Conclusion

For calculating durations of the specified activities, you would need explicit identification of those activities in the provided data. Since no relevant activity labels were included in the provided data to match your interests directly, it would be impossible to output specific durations.

If you have a cleaner dataset with those exact activities included or specified timings related to them, please provide that, and I can help compute the durations accurately. As it stands, the extracted data doesn't cover the activities you mentioned.
