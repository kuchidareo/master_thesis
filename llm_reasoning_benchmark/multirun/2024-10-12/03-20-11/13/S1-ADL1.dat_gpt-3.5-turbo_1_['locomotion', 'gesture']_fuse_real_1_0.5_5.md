### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we need to sum up the timestamps for each activity label and then find the difference between the start and end timestamps. Here is the breakdown for each activity:

1. Relaxing:
- Start timestamp: 0 (first occurrence)
- End timestamp: 1476 (last occurrence)
- Duration: 1476 - 0 = 1476

2. Coffee time:
- Start timestamp: Not found in the provided data
- End timestamp: Not found in the provided data
- Duration: Since specific timestamps for Coffee time are not available in the data, the duration cannot be calculated.

3. Early morning:
- Start timestamp: Not found in the provided data
- End timestamp: Not found in the provided data
- Duration: Since specific timestamps for Early morning are not available in the data, the duration cannot be calculated.

4. Cleanup:
- Start timestamp: Not found in the provided data
- End timestamp: Not found in the provided data
- Duration: Since specific timestamps for Cleanup are not available in the data, the duration cannot be calculated.

5. Sandwich time:
- Start timestamp: Not found in the provided data
- End timestamp: Not found in the provided data
- Duration: Since specific timestamps for Sandwich time are not available in the data, the duration cannot be calculated.

In summary, the duration can be calculated for the "Relaxing" activity based on the provided data, but the durations for the other activities (Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, Sandwich time) cannot be determined as the specific timestamps or labels for those activities are not present in the data.
