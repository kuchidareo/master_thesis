### assistant
To calculate the duration of each of the specified activities: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time from the sensor activity log, we first assume each activity corresponds to specific ranges of timestamps.

However, the table provided only lists various actions along with timestamps but does not directly correspond to these activities. For a proper calculation, there would typically be a predefined mapping of which timestamp ranges correspond to each named activity. Without this information, we can only analyze the sensor labels based on common activity keywords that might point to the named activities.

Let's attempt that based on common sense allocations and assumptions:
- **Relaxing** might be associated with periods that have no specific actions like "Stand" or with long periods without significant activity changes.
- **Coffee time** could be linked with timestamps involving actions like "Open Fridge" and "Drink from Cup".
- **Early morning** could encompass the initial activities of the log or specific morning actions.
- **Cleanup** might be identified by actions like "Clean Table".
- **Sandwich time** could involve opening the fridge and subsequent actions.

### Calculations based on assumptions:

1. **Relaxing**: Periods with prolonged "Stand" or without specified labels:
   - From 0 to initialization of more frequent actions around 330
   - Calculates around frequent Standing periods, e.g., intervals around 673-675, 843, 1049 to 1066.

2. **Coffee time**: 
   - Identified with actions "Open Fridge" and "Drink from Cup": Notably around 336-343, and 843-850.

3. **Early morning**:
   - Typically earlier in the log, till significant consistent activity starts, e.g., possibly initial sequences from 0 to 300.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Direct activity labeled as "Clean Table" at 1440-1451.

5. **Sandwich time**:
   - Possibly involves fridge activities implying meal prep: Actions around fridges detected at specific intervals.

Without detailed mapping to exact timestamps for each activity, this is an approximation. These time period estimations can vary due to subjective interpretations of activities versus sensor actions.

For precise calculations, detailed mapping data of sensor actions to human activities would be essential. Thus, the above attempts rely heavily on assumptions and may not precisely reflect the provided data's intended categorization.
