### assistant
Analyzing the given CSV data, we can identify the activities based on some common actions or groupings found throughout the timestamps. We'll calculate the duration of each of the specified activities: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time.

### Activity Analysis

Upon examining the CSV data, let's associate possible patterns with the activities:

- **Relaxing:** Typically involves inactive states such as standing with periodic "0" labels, other stationary activities.
- **Coffee time:** Often involves interactions like "Drink from Cup".
- **Early morning:** Could involve the initial sequences of the day where common morning activities (like opening doors or using switches) happen.
- **Cleanup:** Involves actions like closing drawers, closing dishwasher, or labeled cleanup activities like "Clean Table".
- **Sandwich time:** Typically involves repeated opening and closing of the fridge, or other food-related actions.

### Calculating Durations

Let's attempt to identify these activity time spans. We'll use the information given to calculate approximate durations:

1. **Coffee time** has actions like "Drink from Cup" occurring between the timestamps 843 and 885.
   
   - **Duration:** 885 - 843 = 42 seconds

2. **Cleanup** may include sequences involving "Close Drawer" (Timestamp 1010) and direct cleanup labeled as such (Timestamp 1440).

   Let's assume the entire observed cleanup operation lasts from the first mention of a drawer until cleaning table ends:
   
   - **Start:** 1010 (first Close Drawer)
   - **End:** 1451 (Clean Table Stand just before ending)
   
   - **Total Duration:** 1451 - 1010 = 441 seconds

3. **Early morning** could involve initial timestamp activities, such as opening doors, initial walking or standing. Assume it occurs in sequences of unique labels at early states.

   Let's assume it starts with the earliest "Open Door 1" or similar activity at the morning:
   
   - **Assumption:** From "Open Door 1" at 366 ends with completed morning while "Walk" initial steady active entry.
   
   - **End Timestamp for morning:** Let's consider before coffee and cleanup, so end at initial "Drink from Cup" 843.
   
   - **Total Duration:** 843 - 366 = 477 seconds

4. **Relaxing** could involve long periods of standing or inactive states:

   We'll conglomerate spans between activities or with predominant standing states in sequences:

   - **Assumed Sections:** Between activities or direct transitions of stationary without drastic actions.
   
   From wider analysis (Valid Range):
   
   - **Start at Relax state:** From 907 (Open Fridge, Standing) directly before transitions of shaking hands.
   - **End just before Early Morning or another action as coffee:** Let's take it to initial Drink cae before more action:
   
   - **Duration Over Multiple Relax sections:** 
   
   - **Summing observed relaxed periods.**

5. **Sandwich time** based on entries "Open Fridge," assume covering sparse spans. You could potentially span multiple openings and closings of a fridge occurrence to simulate a segmented preparation period.

   For specific instances:
   
   - **Initial Open Fridge:** 336 
   - **Ends after returning to activity: Let's find last Stand state after finish, potentially prep-segment ends around closing actions at subsequent states:** Before Drop Fridge 733.
   
   - **Iterative duration evaluation**

   - If based strictly on reach actions in Open/Close spans then directly opening routine to closing aim could estimate the consolidated activity:
   
   - **Final Sum Sandwich**: Calculations base span normalization (checking timing further):

```plaintext
These calculations focus on general assumptions based on descriptions given to each type state/activity.
Should you need precise direct measurement as per data entries further refine by exact observation intentions at such transitions provided.
