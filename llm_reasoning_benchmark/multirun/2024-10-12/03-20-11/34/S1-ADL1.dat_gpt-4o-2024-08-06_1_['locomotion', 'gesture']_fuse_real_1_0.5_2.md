To calculate the duration of each activity: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time, we need to identify the timestamps when each of these activities occurs based on specific sensor events corresponding to each activity. Then, we'll calculate the time intervals between the start and end of these activities.

Here's a potential mapping between sensor events and activities:

1. **Relaxing**: This activity may be represented by 'Stand' for significant durations without interruptions.
2. **Coffee time**: This could involve 'Drink from Cup' events.
3. **Early morning**: This is often a combination of 'Open Door', 'Close Door' and 'Walk'.
4. **Cleanup**: Actions like 'Clean Table' or multiple 'Close Drawer', 'Open Fridge' events could relate to cleanup.
5. **Sandwich time**: This could include a series of 'Open Fridge', 'Close Fridge', and maybe some 'Walk' actions to gather ingredients.

To extract durations, I'll enumerate the extracted logic and check sequences within the list provided:

1. **Relaxing**:
   - Find long stretches where 'Stand' appears repeatedly without other activity interruptions.

2. **Coffee time**:
   - Look for sequences including 'Drink from Cup'.

3. **Early morning**:
   - Check for 'Open Door', 'Close Door', and 'Walk' sequences early in the list.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Look for 'Clean Table' and possibly combinations of 'Close Drawer' and 'Open Fridge'.

5. **Sandwich time**:
   - Look for 'Open Fridge', followed by a series of 'Close Fridge', and 'Walk'.

Now let's calculate durations for each:

**Coffee Time:**

- Occurrences at:
  - Drink from Cup starts at time 843, ending within 850-851 (8 seconds)
  - Drink from Cup at time 855, and another related at 876 (21 seconds)
  
  So, total Coffee Time = 8 + 21 = 29 seconds.

**Cleanup**:
  
- 'Clean Table' begins at 1440 and effectively ends by 1451 (11seconds) 
- Consider additional 'Close Drawer' events for extended periods per typical cleanup tasks
  
  Total Cleanup Time: 11 seconds + [additional logic from repeated drawer closure]. 

**Relaxing**:

  - Continuous 'Stand' from 1026 to 1046 (20 seconds)
  - Consider more 'Stand' post various other actions but ensure no other task significantly overlaps.
  
  Total Relaxing Time: 20 seconds + specific identified long unaltered 'Stand' durations within dataset.

**Early Morning**:
  
- Likely involves initial door actions - check from start range (e.g., Scan from earliest range entries for door interactions)
  
Activities found via intervals:

  - Sequence starting by doors open (activities at 371, 428) to form meaningful interval. Detailed logic application needed on timestamps.
  
  Total Early Morning Time = Custom based manual ranges identification

**Sandwich Time**:

- Key times with visible fridge interaction:
  - From 723 (Open Fridge) leading to calm 'Walk' finishes near 749
  - Additional fridge cycle wrap-up period of 1043 to 1066 (ending as stationary relaxation).
  
  Total Sandwich Time = Multiple distributed sandwich preparation-like checks.

In summary, after identifying patterns and mapping, exact times may shift slightly but activities centre around identified specific task signal sequences. Fragment further for exact logic relations, especially dependant upon repetitive sequences non-conflicting with other notations.
