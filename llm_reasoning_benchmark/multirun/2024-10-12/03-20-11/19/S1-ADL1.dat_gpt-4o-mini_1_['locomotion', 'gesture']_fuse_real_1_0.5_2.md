### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) from the provided data, we need to analyze the timestamps and associated labels in the CSV. 

Since the provided dataset does not explicitly label any entries with "Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", "Cleanup", or "Sandwich time", we can assume that the relevant activities might be represented through combinations of other labels. However, we can look for the closest matches related to cleaning up and having a break involving food (which may refer to coffee or sandwiches), or any indicators suggesting these activities.

### Given Labels and Activities:
1. **Cleanup**: Closest match is "Clean Table".
2. **Coffee time**: This activity does not seem explicitly noted in the data, but it might include any drinking activity.
3. **Sandwich time**: This activity does not seem explicitly noted either. 
4. **Relaxing**: This activity is also not explicitly labeled.
5. **Early morning**: Similarly, there's no direct indicators.

From the data:
- **Cleanup** seems to correlate with the entries "Clean Table".
- For **Coffee time** and **Sandwich time**, we can look at entries related to "Drink from Cup".

### Activity Duration Calculation
**For Cleanup**:
- "Clean Table" occurs multiple times:
   - 1440 (Stand)
   - 1451 (0)
   - Duration for Cleanup from 1440 to 1451 = 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds.
   
**For Coffee Time**:
- Included entries involve "Drink from Cup":
   - Occurs at:
     - 850 (Walk)
     - 851 (Swim)
     - 855 (Swim)
     - Duration from 850 to 855 = 855 - 850 = 5 seconds.
   
### Summary of Durations:
- **Cleanup**: 11 seconds (from 1440 to 1451).
- **Coffee time**: 5 seconds (from 850 to 855).
- **Sandwich time**, **Relaxing**, and **Early morning** do not have identifiable durations based on the provided data.

### Table of Activities and Durations

| Activity       | Duration (seconds) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Cleanup        | 11                  |
| Coffee time    | 5                   |
| Sandwich time  | Not available        |
| Relaxing       | Not available        |
| Early morning   | Not available        |

Without further explicit labels regarding Relaxing, Sandwich time, and Early morning in the dataset, we are unable to provide durations for those activities.
