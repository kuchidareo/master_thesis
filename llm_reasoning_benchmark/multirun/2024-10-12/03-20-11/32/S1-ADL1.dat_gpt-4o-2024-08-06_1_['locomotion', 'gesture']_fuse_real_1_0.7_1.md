### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we will first need to identify where each activity begins and ends within the sequence of timestamps provided in your data. Since there are no explicit labels for “Relaxing,” “Coffee time,” “Early morning,” “Cleanup,” and “Sandwich time” in your data, we'll assume they correspond to specific actions or sequences of actions. However, since I lack direct information or correlations in the provided data, I'll demonstrate general instructions on how to calculate durations if these activities are mapped directly to actions.

1. **Identify Activities:**

   From the given CSV data, we must relate each activity to a specific action or a sequence of actions. For instance:
   
   - **Relaxing** may be associated with "Stand".
   - **Coffee time** may refer to actions around "Open Fridge" or "Close Fridge".
   - **Early morning** might be associated with certain actions happening earlier in the timestamps.
   - **Cleanup** could relate to "Clean Table" or similar actions.
   - **Sandwich time** might also involve "Open Fridge" actions or related movements.

2. **Parse the Data:**

   Assuming each label signifies the start or continuation of its corresponding activity, we would look at each timestamp for transitions between activities.

3. **Calculate Duration:**

   Examine sequences of the designated labels/actions to compute the time difference when the label/action first appears until it changes. For each activity, make note of the start and end timestamps and compute the difference to get the duration.

Since the labels themselves need to be interpreted (no explicit labels like "Relaxing" exist in your given data), you'll need to map the timestamps from actions such as "Stand", "Open Fridge", or any other specific event closely tied to a known activity.

Here's a hypothetical example using sequences labeled "Stand" to compute time:
- For instance, from the data:
  - Start time for **Stand**: 92
  - Continue for timestamps: 339, 355, 371, 384...
  - Identify where another activity begins upon departure from "Stand" labeling.

To proceed, please let me know the mappings between activities and the actions, or clarify how you would like them designated.
