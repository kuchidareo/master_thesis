### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to identify when these activities start and end based on the sensor labels provided. For this, we'll assume that the activities are implicitly indicated by specific sensor labels and timestamp in the CSV file. Here's a logical inference for mapping these activities:

1. **Relaxing** - Generally involves stationary positions like 'Stand' at different timeframes not interrupted by many dynamic activities.
2. **Coffee time** - Implies activities around drinking from a cup, often involving the "Drink from Cup" label.
3. **Early morning** - We might have to assume this to be related to routine activities like "Open Door," "Walk" occurring in a sequence early in the list.
4. **Cleanup** - Associated with tasks such as "Clean Table."
5. **Sandwich time** - Might involve sequences around "Open Fridge," "Open Drawer," and related preparations.

Let's extract and calculate durations:

**Relaxing**:
- Assume "Relaxing" covers periods of standing with limited other activities that typically break concentration. Checks around timeframes with consecutively "standing" without others can give us a trend:
  - Several consecutive "Stand" periods are observed such as:
    - From timestamp 1357 to 1362 = 5 units
    - From timestamp 1051 to 1063 = 12 units
  - Calculating the sum for some obvious relaxing patterns detected, it may add up to around a number of units. Similar calculations for other regions would follow necessary context availability.

**Coffee time**:
- Related to "Drink from Cup":
  - Starting 843, duration till timestamp 907 - which indicates a uninterrupted or continuous period evidence of drinking. This can be incident around these qualifiers.

**Early morning**:
- Indicate initial period from Open Door to subsequent morning activities:
  - From timestamp 366 intricate into early routine pattern behaviors.

**Cleanup**:
- From "Clean Table" actions:
  - Timestamp 1440 to 1451 between "Clean Table" patterns.

**Sandwich time**:
- Involve fridge interactions.
  - Several alternating "Open Fridge" with corresponding periods could define consuming interval, given assuming patterns of making sandwich.

By calculating these plus extracting from the context around, rough estimates convert activities described in evolving timestamps cumulatively, forming key distinct periods. For accuracy goals, these interpretations should bar quantitative inference within context elucidative of operations times.
