### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity mentioned in the sensor label table, we need to analyze the timestamps for each activity and calculate the time elapsed between each activity transition. Here are the steps to calculate the duration of each activity:

1. Identify the start and end timestamps for each activity.
2. Calculate the duration by subtracting the start timestamp from the end timestamp for each activity.
3. Sum up the durations for each activity separately.

Let's proceed to calculate the duration of each activity: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time based on the provided sensor label data. After analyzing the data, if necessary, we can also provide insights into what might have happened during specific time durations.
