### assistant
To analyze the activity durations based on the provided sensor label data, we will extract the timestamps for each activity label: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time. After collecting the timestamps, we will calculate the duration for each activity.

Given the data you've provided, it appears that there are no explicit labels for "Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", and "Sandwich time". However, I can identify only the "Cleanup" activity, which appears as "Clean Table". 

To calculate the duration of the "Cleanup" activity:
1. Identify the timestamps corresponding to "Clean Table".
2. Calculate the duration based on the differences between start and end timestamps.

### Cleanup Activity
- **Activity**: Clean Table
- **Timestamps**: 
  - Start: 1451
  - End: 1451 (since it only appears once, we will not have an end timestamp directly related)

To get the durations of activities like "Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", and "Sandwich time", we need to clarify if there are other synonymous labels in the data that could be classified under those categories. 

Assuming "Relaxing" could be represented by "Stand", "Coffee time" might relate to "Drink from Cup", "Early morning" is unclear, but "Cleanup" would be represented, and "Sandwich time" isn't captured either.

Letâ€™s summarize what we can do from your CSV data:

### Found Activity
1. **Cleanup (Clean Table)**: 
   - Start: 1451 
   - Duration: 0 (it seems to be an isolated occurrence, without an explicit ending)

---

### Summary of Analysis
- **Cleanup**: Not calculable in terms of duration since we only have a single timestamp.
- Activities related to "Relaxing", "Coffee time" are present but should be formally defined or consistent with explicit labels.

If you have slight variations or synonyms among these labels or further activity examples, please provide those for a more comprehensive analysis!
