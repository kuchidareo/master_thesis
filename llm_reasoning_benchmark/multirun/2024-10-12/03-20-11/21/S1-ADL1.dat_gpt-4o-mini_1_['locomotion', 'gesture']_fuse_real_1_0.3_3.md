### assistant
To analyze the provided sensor data and calculate the duration of the specified activities (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we first need to identify timestamps corresponding to the activities listed, if they exist in the data.

However, it appears that the provided data does not label any activities explicitly as "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," or "Sandwich time." The only relevant activity indicated is "Cleanup," which seems to refer to the "Clean Table" activity.

1. **Cleanup Activity**: This activity occurs at the timestamps 1440 and 1451, meaning it lasts from 1440 to 1451.

Calculating its duration:
- Start time: 1440
- End time: 1451
- Duration: \(1451 - 1440 = 11 \text{ seconds}\)

For the other activities (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Sandwich time), there are no entries in the dataset that correspond to these labels.

### Summary of Results:
- **Cleanup Activity Duration**: 11 seconds.
- **Relaxing Duration**: Not found in the data.
- **Coffee time Duration**: Not found in the data.
- **Early morning Duration**: Not found in the data.
- **Sandwich time Duration**: Not found in the data. 

If needed, you could revise the input or clarify if there are specific labels to look for.
