To calculate the duration of each activity, we'll need to identify the time intervals corresponding to the activities mentioned: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time. Since the CSV data doesn't directly mention these activities by name, we need to make some assumptions based on the timestamps and common human activity sequences implied by the sensor labels.

1. **Relaxing:** Typically involves undisturbed activities. Hence, periods where 'Stand', 'Sit', or similar static activities are predominant.

2. **Coffee time:** May involve interactions such as opening a fridge, using a cup, or standing for a while without much movement.

3. **Early morning:** Often involves sequences such as waking up, moving around, and could be inferred from activities like 'Walk', 'Open Door', etc., happening at the beginning of the list.

4. **Cleanup:** Likely linked to actions like 'Clean Table', 'Wash', or others that involve cleaning-related activities.

5. **Sandwich time:** Might involve activities like opening the fridge, standing, and possibly using the counter.

Given the dataset doesn't explicitly mark when each activity starts or stops, and there are no clear segments labeled directly with these activitiy names, it's challenging to provide exact durations. However, we can infer these based on typical activity sequences extracted from the sensor labels.

Let's dissect the CSV data to make these intelligent guesses:

- **Relaxing:** Might be inferred when there are long sequences of 'Stand' without much other activity.
  - Example: Look at periods with consecutive 'Stand' and/or very low movement.

- **Coffee time:** Look for cues like 'Open Fridge', 'Drink from Cup', and periods standing afterward.
  - Example: Timestamp ranges where 'Open Fridge' or 'Drink from Cup' actions are found.

- **Early morning:** Could be suggested by initial active sequences, like a cluster of activities such as 'Stand', 'Walk', and opening/closing of doors.
  - Example: Initial sequences in the dataset around timestamp 0.

- **Cleanup:** Search for signs of 'Clean Table' or similar hints and link them with surrounding timestamps.
  - Example: Places where specific cleanup-related sensor readings are recorded.

- **Sandwich time:** May feature 'Open Fridge', 'Stand', periods of 'Walk' adjacent, and less erratic motion.
  - Example: Timestamp areas with fridge or cabinet interactions.

Without explicit timestamps marked for these activities, note that the analysis is partly subjective and based on common scenario inferences. A more precise analysis would require either additional context (e.g., activity logs or notes) or labeled data where each interval is classified manually for validation.
