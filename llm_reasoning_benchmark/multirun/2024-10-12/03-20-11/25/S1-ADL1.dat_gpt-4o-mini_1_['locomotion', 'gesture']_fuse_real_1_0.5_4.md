### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) from the provided CSV data, I first need to identify the timestamps corresponding to each activity based on its label. Unfortunately, the data you provided does not include the specified activities (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time).

The CSV data appears to contain timestamps with other activities such as Swim, Walk, Stand, and Shake Hands. Therefore, I cannot compute the duration of the specified activities as they do not appear in the provided dataset.

If you have a different dataset that includes those specific activities or if you can clarify how these activities associate with the labels in the provided data, I would be glad to assist you further.
