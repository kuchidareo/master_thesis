### assistant
To analyze the provided sensor data and calculate the duration of specific activities (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to identify when each activity starts and ends based on the timestamps. 

Since the specific activity labels to track aren't explicitly outlined in this dataset, I'll first identify potential time periods that might correspond to the activities mentioned:

1. **Clean Up (Cleanup)**: The term "Clean Table" appears in the dataset. We'll mark the start and end for this activity.
2. **Coffee Time**: There are no explicit indications for "Coffee Time." However, activities related to drinking could be indicative of this.
3. **Relaxing**: No clear indicators are evident in the dataset for relaxing. 
4. **Early Morning**: Again, no explicit indicators for early morning activities.
5. **Sandwich time**: No explicit indicators for this activity in the dataset either.

Based on our analysis, we will focus on "Clean Table" for the Cleanup category and activities around drinking as indications of Coffee Time.

### Step 1: Identify "Clean Table" Activity
- The timestamps for "Clean Table" in the dataset are:
  - Start: 1440 (Stand)
  - End: 1451 (Swim)
  
Calculating the duration for Cleanup:
- Duration = End Time - Start Time = 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds

### Step 2: Identify Drinking Activities (potential "Coffee time")
The drinking activities are:
- Drink from Cup (Stand) at timestamp 843
- Drink from Cup (Walk) at timestamp 850
- Drink from Cup (Stand) at timestamp 851 
- Drink from Cup (0) at timestamp 851
- Drink from Cup (Swim) at timestamp 865

Analyzing the time frames:
- The last drinking activity recorded is at 865 and the first at 843.
- Duration = 865 - 843 = 22 seconds

### Summary of Activity Durations
- **Cleanup (Clean Table)**: 11 seconds
- **Coffee Time (Drinking activities)**: 22 seconds

Because Relaxing, Early morning, and Sandwich time do not have identifiable equivalents in the provided data, we cannot calculate durations for those activities.

Overall, here are the durations based on the sensor data you provided:
- **Clean Up**: 11 seconds
- **Coffee Time**: 22 seconds
