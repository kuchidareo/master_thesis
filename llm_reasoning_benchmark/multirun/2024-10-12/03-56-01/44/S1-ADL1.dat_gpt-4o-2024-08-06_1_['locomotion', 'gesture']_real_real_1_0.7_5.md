To calculate the duration of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we'll analyze the timestamps and corresponding labels.

The sequence of activities doesn't explicitly state when each activity starts and ends, so we'll assume that certain patterns or key events signify a particular activity. Here's the analysis based on typical household routines and the given data:

1. **Relaxing**: Characterized by events such as "Sit," "Stand," "Lie," or "None" at extended durations without frequent transitions. 

2. **Coffee time**: Often associated with actions like "Drink from Cup" and other brief "Walk" or "Sit" transitions around those events.

3. **Early morning**: Typically involves a lot of "Walking," opening doors, perhaps "Open Fridge," "Close Drawer," and other activities that signify starting a day.

4. **Cleanup**: Involves actions like "Clean Table," "Close Dishwasher," and "Walk."

5. **Sandwich time**: Could be indicated by "Open Fridge," "Close Drawer," combined with "Walk," suggesting preparing food.

Here's how we might extract these activities based on the given patterns:

- **Relaxing**: Look for extended periods involving "Sit" or "Lie" and "None" activity.
- **Coffee time**: Look for "Drink from Cup" followed by brief other activities like "Walk" or "Sit."
- **Early morning**: Period at the start with high frequency of "Walk" and "Open/Close Door."
- **Cleanup**: Periods with "Clean Table," "Close Dishwasher," or multiple similar events.
- **Sandwich time**: Patterns with "Open Fridge" followed by "Sit" or "Walk."

Now, let's assess approximate duration based on timestamps:

- **Relaxing**: Observing durations chiefly with "Sit" or "None" at long intervals. For example, the sequence from timestamp 747 to 843 suggests a relaxing break duration of 96 units (747 to 843).

- **Coffee time**: Rapid transitions around "Drink from Cup," e.g., around timestamps 699, 850, 1007 aligning with short actions suggest they're related with coffee task time.

- **Early morning**: Likely could involve activities early in the list with lots of "Walk" and "Open/Close Door," such as from the start till around the first lengthy "Sit" at 438 which lasts till 447 â€” thus could be around the first 438 - 435 = 3 time units or slightly more.

- **Cleanup**: 1440 - 1419 time (21 units), encompassing multiple "Clean Table" indications and "Stand" relating to potential cleanup tasks.

- **Sandwich time**: Involve "Open Fridge" and subsequent food preparation actions, perhaps with "Sit" or "Walk," can see from 724 to 733 with walk and potentially dining 10 units duration.

To sum up, durations in time units suggested:
- Relaxing: Around 96 units
- Coffee time: Small intervals within timestamps around cup drinking, like 699 and 850
- Early morning: Primarily initial walk and open fridge activities around first lengthy sits
- Cleanup: Seen primarily in timestamps between 1440 - 1419 (21 units)
- Sandwich time: Occurring around meal preparation times identified like 724 to 733 (9 units). 

These guesses largely involve approximation on typical start, pause, repeat sequences in sensor movement.
