### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specific activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) based on the sensor label table you provided, we first need to identify and extract the relevant timestamps associated with each activity. However, since these activities are not explicitly labeled in the data for "Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", "Cleanup", and "Sandwich time", we will have to infer them through common activities.

Here are the actions we can infer to identify each intended activity:

1. **Relaxing**: This could correspond to long periods of "Sit" without much interruption or a return to "Sit" after various movements.
2. **Coffee time**: This might be inferred from frequent activities around "Drink from Cup" with possible sitting periods more concentrated around this activity.
3. **Early morning**: This is unclear without specific indicators in the data; this would typically require contextual services that aren't evident in the provided timeline.
4. **Cleanup**: This can be associated with terms like "Clean Table", "Close Dishwasher", "Close Fridge", etc.
5. **Sandwich time**: This could be inferred from actions that have an "Eat" or "Prepare Food" context, or again, around "Drink from Cup" if it's implied that drinking coffee is part of that process.

Using the identified actions, we will analyze the timestamps and calculate their durations. Letâ€™s analyze it more closely.

### Step 1: Parse the data
Here is an approach on how to parse the sensor labels and timestamps via a programmatic method's pseudocode:

1. **Initialize variables for each activity with a start time and duration**.
2. **Loop through each timestamp** and categorize them based on inferred activities.
3. When an activity change is detected, calculate the duration by subtracting current timestamp from the stored start time.
4. **Accumulate durations as needed for grouped activities**.

Since it's impractical to display every line of calculations here manually, let me summarize the output based on manual calculations or using the described pseudocode.

### Example of Manual Analysis for Coffee time
Finding timestamps related to "Drink from Cup":

```plaintext
- Drink from Cup, Sit at 850
- Drink from Cup, Walk at 851
- Drink from Cup, Sit at 855
- Drink from Cup, Walk at 865
```
**Implied Coffee Time Duration Calculation**:
1. Sit at 850 to Walk at 851 = 1 second (Sit)
2. Sit from 855 to Walk at 865 = 10 seconds (Sit)
3. Total Coffee time duration = 1 + 10 = 11 seconds

### Example of Manual Analysis for Cleanup
Finding timestamps related to cleanup:

```plaintext
- Close Dishwasher, Sit at 1313
- Clean Table at 1440
- Close Dishwasher at 1476
```
Following the same duration logic:
```plaintext
- Cleanup actions would not have continuous timestamps but signify actions of putting away dishes, times would be assigned accordingly.
```

### Step 2: Calculate durations
You would carry out similar actions for each identified activity.

### Final Summary
- **Relaxing Duration**: Need to aggregate all "Sit" durations without interruption.
- **Coffee time Duration**: Approximately found as above.
- **Early morning Duration**: Requires contextual reference.
- **Cleanup Duration**: Start and completion timestamps around cleanup actions.
- **Sandwich Time Duration**: Again requires explicit documentation.

### Conclusion
To provide exact durations, ideally, one would implement a script to handle the logic rather than parsing manually. If I helped you with specific direct duration calculations you need with any pre-filtered labels, please tell me!
