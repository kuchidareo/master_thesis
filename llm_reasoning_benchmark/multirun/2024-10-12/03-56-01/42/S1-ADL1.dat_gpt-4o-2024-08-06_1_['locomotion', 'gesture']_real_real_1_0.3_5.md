### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we first need to identify the specific segments in the data that correspond to each activity mentioned: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time. Unfortunately, these labels are not explicitly provided in the CSV data you shared.

However, we can hypothesize which activities match the segments of the data based on typical behavior patterns. Here's a suggestion:

1. **Relaxing**: Could correspond to periods of sitting or standing without much walking or interaction, like sitting activities that are sequential or combined with standing and no interacting events like opening doors or using appliances.

2. **Coffee time**: May involve sequences where "Drink from Cup" is present in the activity label, combined with stationary actions (sitting or standing).

3. **Early morning**: This could represent the initial period of activity, perhaps the first few entries until a pattern changes significantly (often sitting or simple standing after waking up).

4. **Cleanup**: Typically involves multiple actions like opening/closing doors, drawers, and potentially walking around, often followed by standing still. Look for sequences indicating repeated opening and closing of items like dishwashers and drawers.

5. **Sandwich time**: Might involve sequences where the fridge is frequently accessed (both opening and closing) combined with walking and possibly sitting.

Based on these patterns, let's establish each activity's timestamp range and calculate its duration:

- **Relaxing**: From timestamp `371` (Sit) to `673` (Stand). Duration is `673 - 371 = 302` seconds.
  
- **Coffee time**: Based on "Drink from Cup" entries.
  - First coffee session: From `843` to `885`. Duration is `885 - 843 = 42` seconds.
  - Second coffee session: From `1007` to `1109`. Duration is `1109 - 1007 = 102` seconds.

- **Early morning**: Hypothetically, from the start (`92`) to when a new pattern begins. Let's assume this ends at `347`. Duration is `347 - 92 = 255` seconds.

- **Cleanup**: From `674` (frequent drawer and door activity) to just before "Relaxing" resumes at the start of "Coffee Time" around `843`. Duration is `843 - 674 = 169` seconds.

- **Sandwich time**: Based on frequent fridge access.
  - First fridge session: From `907` to `909`. Duration is `909 - 907 = 2` seconds.
  - Second fridge session: From `1313` to `1328`. Duration is `1328 - 1313 = 15` seconds.

Keep in mind these are based on assumptions from typical activity patterns since the labels you stated are not explicitly marked in the dataset. If more context or a reference guide (time periods) is provided, the identification can become significantly more accurate.
