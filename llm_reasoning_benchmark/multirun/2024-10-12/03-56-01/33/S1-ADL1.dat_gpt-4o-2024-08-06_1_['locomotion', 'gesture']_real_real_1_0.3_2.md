To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) from the provided CSV dataset, we need to identify the events that correspond to each of these activities based on the sensor labels and timestamps.

Looking at the events, we can make some assumptions about which events might correspond to which activities:

1. **Relaxing**: This could involve periods where there is sitting or standing without much movement. Events with "Sit" and periods without significant activity could potentially represent Relaxing.

2. **Coffee time**: This might involve using cups and the fridge, so any occurrence of "Drink from Cup" can be considered part of Coffee time.

3. **Early morning**: This might involve initial movements after getting up, so it could be associated with "Open Door 1" events or early periods of walking.

4. **Cleanup**: This could involve various actions like using drawers and possibly cleaning. Events like "Clean Table" and closing/opening drawers might be part of Cleanup.

5. **Sandwich time**: This might be associated with fridge and drawer use, so events like "Open Fridge" followed by a sequence of draw and platform usage could indicate Sandwich time.

Now, to calculate the duration of each activity:

1. **Relaxing**: Sum up the duration of consecutive "Sit" and "Stand" events without overlapping with other clear activity signatures.

2. **Coffee time**: Look at "Drink from Cup" events and their surrounding time frame.

3. **Early morning**: Could be inferred as a series of actions from a starting point, usually early in the dataset timeline.

4. **Cleanup**: Duration can be seen around "Clean Table", "Close Drawer" events.

5. **Sandwich time**: Look at sequences involving "Open Fridge", possibly followed by "Open Drawer".

Now, estimating the durations from the timestamps:

1. **Relaxing**:
   - Find sequences where the person is predominantly "Sit" with no immediate object interaction or stand sequence.
   - Example: Timestamps 1037 to 1040 could reflect relaxing (approx 3 seconds).
   - Iterate over similar patterns to sum up.

2. **Coffee time**:
   - Major indication during "Drink from Cup" events.
   - E.g., series of "Drink from Cup" events from 850 to 870 (approx 20 seconds).
   - Subsequent cups could increase this duration.

3. **Early morning**:
   - Consider a starting period like first "walk" from point, such as from 0 to 500.
   - Deduct activity-specific periods identified for other activities within.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Series like 1440 to 1460, involving "Clean Table", sittings and similar interactivities (20 seconds approx).

5. **Sandwich time**:
   - Sequence involving "Open Fridge" and drawer actions, e.g., 1311 to 1330 (19 seconds).

Keep in mind these are interpretative approaches based on the activity data provided. Real activity log data often requires domain-specific heuristics and labeling standards. To improve accuracy of these calculations, a timestamp and label correlation would be statistically analyzed based on additional sampling or known behavior patterns.
