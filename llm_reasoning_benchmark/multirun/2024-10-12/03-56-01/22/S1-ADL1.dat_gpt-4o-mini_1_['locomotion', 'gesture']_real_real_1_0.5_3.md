### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we first need to identify the relevant timestamps associated with each defined activity. 

1. **Define Activity Start and End Points**: Since the provided data does not include specific labels for the activities you mentioned (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), let’s make assumptions based on typical human activities associated with those labels:

    - **Relaxing**: Timed continuous Sit states
    - **Coffee time**: Timed continuous Drink from Cup while sitting
    - **Early morning**: Initial activities (like Stand, Walk) usually after waking; we can assume they're from the beginning until you start using the coffee.
    - **Cleanup**: Activities labeled as “Clean Table” or “Close Dishwasher”
    - **Sandwich time**: Assuming this might be when activities involve preparing/eating a sandwich; looking for relevant clues in activities or surrounding context.

2. **Calculate Durations**: For each identified activity:

- compute the difference between end time and start time for consecutive matching states of interest.

Let's compute the durations.

### Analyzing Relevant Parts of the Data:

1. **Relaxing**:
   - Starts from 0, Sit (261) to 0, Sit (1504).
   - Total relaxation includes all breaks in Sit (Sit at 261, 355, 428, 699, 700, 874, 876, 900, 1448, 1490, 1504).

2. **Coffee time**:
   - Relates to "Drink from Cup" (timing occurrences at 378, 843, 850, 851). 
   - Significant when combined with Sit actions.

3. **Early Morning**:
   - Early activities are from the start until the coffee seems to be sipped (up to the first "Drink from Cup").

4. **Cleanup**: 
   - Encounters the actions of cleaning at 1440 - 1451 (Clean Table).

5. **Sandwich Time**:
   - This might not be explicitly stated but could be inferred if there are associated actions like “Open Fridge” or “Close Dishwasher” that are indicative of prepping.

### Calculating Durations:

Here is a hypothetical analysis based on the provided activity log:

1. **Relaxing**: 
   - Total duration can be calculated covering all Sit timestamps ranging from 261 to 1504.
   
   The periods of sitting for relaxation:
   - Between 261 and the next Sit at 355 = 355 - 261 = 94 seconds.
   - Between 428 and the next Sit at 699 = 699 - 428 = 271 seconds. 
   - Adding all relevant timelines observed with Sit states.

2. **Coffee Time**: 
   - Coffee period consists of:
   - Time between 378 (Drink from Cup) to the next action not being Drink from Cup if there's a Sit.
   - Adding each time span around sitting actions while drinking from the cup.

3. **Early Morning Duration**: 
   - The total starts up until the coffee time acquisition.

4. **Cleanup**: 
   - Duration can include from 1440 to 1451.
   - Cleanup time is small as it's from 1440 and ends right at 1451.

5. **Sandwich Time**: 
   - Depends on actions associated with food prep without direct timestamps.
   - Could require specific contextual notes from the activity log.

### Summary Analysis 

Based on the recognized activities, total durations would require concrete methods to programmatically extract intervals through a detailed script or specialized data analysis tool to derive exact numerical duration values. Activity recognition and labeling, in this case, requires manual introspection or machine learning/AI classification models to ascertain the specifics in real use cases effectively.

Would you like to delve further into querying or processing specific timestamps to achieve concrete numerical outputs?
