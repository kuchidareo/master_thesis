### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to infer the time intervals corresponding to each activity based on the given sensor label data. 

Let's examine the activities:

1. **Relaxing**: Typically associated with stationary positions such as "Sit" or "Stand" within a certain environment, possibly after a task has been completed.
2. **Coffee Time**: Associated with activities related to drinking, such as "Drink from Cup".
3. **Early Morning**: May be associated with initial activities after waking up, typically around the beginning of the dataset.
4. **Cleanup**: Involves opening and closing drawers, dishwashers, and possibly other household chores.
5. **Sandwich Time**: Might involve kitchen-related actions like opening the fridge, drawers, and other related tasks.

Here's an analysis based on the provided data:

**Relaxing**:
- Look for long sequences of "Sit" or not much movement.
- One can argue relaxing might be from 896 to 947 (51 minutes) and bits of 1419 (7 minutes), presuming this interpretation about where one might rest.

**Coffee Time**:
- Activities involving "Drink from Cup".
- From 704 (Drink from Cup) to around 747 (43 minutes) and from 1401 (Drink from Cup) to 1404 (3 minutes).

**Early Morning**:
- Typically the earlier parts of the data, say from 92 to 427 (335 duration), could be related to the waking-up routine.

**Cleanup**:
- Involves a high frequency of "Open/Close Drawer" and "Open/Close Dishwasher".
- Activities from 336 to 436 (100 duration) and scattered smaller segments later; interpreting these through a higher frequency of mentioned activities is needed.

**Sandwich Time**:
- Activities involving "Open Fridge" and then possible sequences.
- From sequences like 1043 to 1073 (30 minutes), a separate period capturing a fridge interaction and transition to a walk.

Please note: Without explicit context or clear delineations, identifying these periods requires a degree of inference and assumption based on typical daily activities and patterns.
