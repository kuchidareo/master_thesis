### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity based on the provided sensor data, we need to analyze the timestamps and determine the timeline of each activity label. Here is the analysis:

1. **Relaxing:**
    - Generally, activities like sitting or standing with no significant actions might be considered relaxing. From the data, any timestamps labeled as `Sit` or `Stand` without specific actions could be classified as relaxing.
    - Example: From timestamp 0 to 92 (`Stand`), from 261 to 272 (`Sit`), and many others scattered throughout the data set.

2. **Coffee time:**
    - Activities involving "Drink from Cup" likely indicate coffee time.
    - Example timestamps for "Drink from Cup": 850, 851, 855, 865, 1066, 1401.

3. **Early morning:**
    - This term isn't tied to specific sensor data in the provided dataset, so we might consider initial events as "Early morning."
    - Possible candidates could be the earliest time periods around 0 (up to a certain reasonable timestamp before any specific activities start and based on domain assumptions).

4. **Cleanup:**
    - Actions indicating cleaning or organizing, such as interactions with "Dishwasher," "Drawer," or "Clean Table," would suggest cleanup activities.
    - Examples include: timestamps involving "Close Dishwasher," "Open Drawer," "Close Drawer," or "Clean Table": e.g., 389, 700, 851, 1451, etc.

5. **Sandwich time:**
    - Activities associated with the fridge might indicate food preparation times, such as sandwiches.
    - Example timestamps involving the fridge: 336, 723, 1043, 1313.

To determine the duration, we'll count intervals between these actions that align with these activity descriptions and derive durations from this data.

### Analyzed Durations (based on assumptions):
1. **Relaxing:** Sum of intervals where user was sitting or standing without further active tasks around them.
2. **Coffee time:** Duration in intervals with "Drink from Cup": e.g., 850 to 862, 865 to 874, providing around 26 seconds.
3. **Early morning:** Defined from start timestamp up to the first significant activity threshold.
4. **Cleanup:** Total estimated time from aggregates of identified cleanup times, e.g., total time during dishwasher and drawer activities.
5. **Sandwich time:** Duration across fridge interactions potentially indicating sandwich preparation actions.

Without explicit start and end timestamps for each, one would need to use domain-specific assumptions to mark clear beginning and end periods for these activities. Analysis involves deriving these using context and grouping activities logically from the data. Exact integration of real-world knowledge is needed for precise boundaries.
