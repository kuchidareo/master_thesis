### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity, we should first define or extract sequences of sensor data that correspond to the activities: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time. Since the CSV data provided appears to be raw sensor data without explicit activity labels, these activities need to be interpreted from context.

I'll try to make reasonable assumptions about these activities based on typical interpretations:

1. **Relaxing** - Associated with periods of Sitting or None.
2. **Coffee time** - Often involves kitchen activities, so sequences with activities involving drawers, sitting, and actions near the dishwasher might correspond to coffee-making.
3. **Early morning** - Could be linked with the first active sequences of the day.
4. **Cleanup** - Might involve a lot of 'Walk', 'Stand', and 'None' with interactions like close/open drawers and dishwasher.
5. **Sandwich time** - Could involve times with actions around the fridge, standing, and sitting, similar to coffee, but potentially with sequences that also involve 'Walk'.

Here's a rough analysis and guess for each activity:

### Early Morning
- Start examining initial sequences; assume everything up until a significant 'sit' after a lot of 'stand' and 'walk' might be early morning. 
- It starts at timestamp 92 and goes up to around the first few 'sit' labels or interactions.
- Rounded approximate timestamps: 92 to 366.

### Relaxing
- Periods with sustained 'Sit' or 'None' without many 'Walk' actions.
- Distinct sections appear at various points:
  - From 678 to 726: several sitting actions
  - 747 to 896: mostly sitting
  - Another potential resting period from 1406 to 1439

### Coffee Time
- Kitchen activities, possibly timed when there's a sequence involving opening and closing drawers, sitting, and standing.
- Look for close interactions suggesting the kitchen context (e.g., drawers or fridge) around breakfast time.
- Possibly around timestamps 704 to 718, involving a mix of 'sit', 'stand', and open drawer activities.

### Cleanup
- Defined by a large number of 'Walk', 'Stand', opening and closing drawers or dishwasher.
- Examine sequences with many 'Walk' and 'Stand': 
  - Potential long stretches between 679 (significant walk after waking) to around 700
  - Another possibly between 1040 to 1109, several cupboard and drawer interactions

### Sandwich Time
- Should involve fridge and possible sit-after-walk transitions - such as intervals where fridge or associated drawer actions occur.
- Timestamps might be around 1326 to 1365, as they include walking, sitting, and opening/closing of doors and fridge actions.

Given that thereâ€™s ambiguity without explicit labels for activities, consider these approximations while remaining aware the real activities may vary without concrete chain of sensor events. Based on these rough categorizations, you can calculate the durations as difference in timestamps.
