### assistant
To analyze the duration of each activity from the given CSV data, we need to consider the timestamps and determine for how long each labeled activity occurred. However, the provided data labels specific actions at specific timestamps, not activity segments directly associated with each activity like "Relaxing" or "Coffee time."

Based on the pattern of labels, we can infer possible activity segments. Below is an example breakdown:

1. **Relaxing**: May involve periods with "Sit" actions with minimal movement.
2. **Coffee Time**: Might correspond to sequences involving "Drink from Cup" and movements around the kitchen, such as "Open Fridge" or "Close Drawer."
3. **Early Morning**: Likely involves a range of activities as the morning routine begins, which may or may not be explicitly marked with unique labels.
4. **Cleanup**: Actions like "Clean Table," "Close Dishwasher," or frequent drawer/door operations could indicate cleaning activities.
5. **Sandwich Time**: Similar to coffee time but may not have enough distinct activity markers unless related.

Let's calculate the approximate durations:

**Note**: The provided data suggests each entry's time is cumulative since the actions have increasing timestamps. The units are likely seconds, but without a clear activity label, a precise segmentation cannot be directly inferred. The durations mentioned are interpretations based on repetitive patterns or specific actions associated with common knowledge of these activities.

### Approximate Analysis:

1. **Relaxing**: 

   - Many "Sit" entries, e.g., around timestamps like 272, 747, 900. These periods involve minimal activity transitions.
   - Duration example: Timestamp 747 to 900 (approx. 153 units).

2. **Coffee Time**:

   - Involves "Drink from Cup." Example timestamps: Around 704, 855, spread over several instances.
   - Duration example: Between activities could involve periods briefly segmented by "Sit" or related actions.

3. **Early Morning**:

   - Initial actions could simulate this phase, starting from the first timestamp to the first notable change.
   - Duration based on events before significant activity shifts, potentially till midpoints like 400-500.

4. **Cleanup**:

   - Involves actions such as "Close Dishwasher," "Clean Table."
   - Example: Possible sequence around timestamp 1451, or fragmented across.
   - Duration could be diverse depending on how these actions cluster.

5. **Sandwich Time**:

   - Requires inference from kitchen-related actions with repeated "Open/Close Drawer."
   - Multiple kitchen actions indicate activity at segments like 720-800.

### Caveats:
- Without clear labeled Holistic segments (e.g., explicit "Relaxing"), each activity's duration must rely on contextual inference based on action repetition and known likely activities.
- Activity start-stop calculations depend on recognizing when repetitive actions start/stop, indicating potential ongoing activities surrounding those actions.

### Final Insight:
- The correct detailing of these activities would heavily rely on understanding what actions the relevant sensor logging marked implicitly. Inner and adjacent actions suggest patterns, but without an explicit marker indicating activity change, assumptions remain informative but not definitive.
