### assistant
To calculate the duration for each activity, we need to check within which activity period each timestamp falls. The labels seem to describe sequences of actions typical of daily activities. Given the labels available, let's make educated guesses about which labels correspond to each named activity, based on typical daily routines:

1. **Relaxing**: Periods where there are frequent "Sit" and "Stand" labels, possibly interspersed with short "Walks".
2. **Coffee time**: This likely includes repetitive "Drink from Cup" labels along with "Sit" or "Stand".
3. **Early morning**: Likely to be the initial sequence in the timeline, possibly dominated by "Walk" and preparation activities like quickly opening/closing drawers or fridges.
4. **Cleanup**: We would expect "Clean Table" or sequences of "Stand" and "Walk".
5. **Sandwich time**: Likely involves "Open Fridge", "Close Fridge", and "Stand"/"Sit".

With this idea, you can segment the timeline into different activities by looking for the possible sequences from the dataset:

1. **Relaxing**:
   - Frequent and extended periods of "Sit" activities, e.g., between 679-947 could be one such period.

2. **Coffee time**:
   - Repeated instances of "Drink from Cup" accompanied by "Sit" or "Stand", for example, around timestamps 700-850.

3. **Early morning**:
   - The beginning of the timeline, with frequent "Walks", for example, from the start to around timestamp 500 (the beginning part where there's frequent walking with some interaction with doors, fridge indicating getting ready).

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Around timestamps where we see "Clean Table", such as at 1440-1451. Potentially also times with a lot of closing drawers and dishwashers.

5. **Sandwich time**:
   - Periods with repeated fridge interactions indicating making food, e.g., around timestamps 700-1000.

Estimate the start and end of each activity period, then calculate its duration by subtracting the start timestamp from the end timestamp and summing all such durations for each activity. Here is an approximate guide based on typical patterns:

- Relaxing: Multiple occurrences between the sitting segments and just after initial activities
- Coffee time: Around the time when repeated drinking activity is observed
- Early Morning: Clusters of activities at the start of the timeline
- Cleanup: After morning, with standalone cleaning actions or mass opening and closing of kitchen items
- Sandwich time: When substantial fridge interactions are noted

Feel free to ask if you'd like a deeper analysis into any specific sections of these activities.
