To determine the duration of each specified activity, we need to group periods based on patterns of sensor activities. Let's focus on recognizing these activity segments from the given data. I'll provide a brief analysis of each activity based on the activity sequence given:

1. **Relaxing**: Typically involves periods of "Sit" and "Lie" without the interference of "Walk" or active tasks like "Clean Table", "Close Drawer", etc.

2. **Coffee time**: Might involve interacting with cups and the fridge to fetch coffee ingredients, activities like "Open Fridge", "Drink from Cup", with a majority of "Sit" and occasionally "Stand".

3. **Early morning**: Usually a sequence that begins with activities right after a period of rest, possibly identified by transitioning from "Lie" to active states like "Walk", "Open Door", etc.

4. **Cleanup**: Involves activities like "Close Drawer", "Close Dishwasher", "Clean Table", and significant movement with "Stand" and "Walk".

5. **Sandwich time**: Similar to coffee time, but might involve more activities with the fridge, such as "Open Fridge", "Close Fridge", and then eating phases denoted by the "Sit" command post retrieving food items.

Now, let's calculate the duration for each activity based on the provided sequences:

1. **Relaxing**:
   - 1102 ("None") to 1311 ("Walk") → Duration: 209 seconds

2. **Coffee time**:
   - Identified between sensor activities around drinking/cup interactions. See 843 ("Drink from Cup") to 885: 
   - Occurrences from 843 ("Drink from Cup") to 885 ("Walk") – Duration: 42 seconds
   - 679 ("Drink from Cup" as sensors are used while sitting and transitioning to stand until around 699). Duration large period overlaps with other activities but smallest coffee-only 679-690: 11 seconds approx.

3. **Early morning**:
   - Seems to begin after the initial "Lie" at 1109 to indicate the start of the day with first few actions, but might not be distinct in this log. Using 00 to 199 indicates non-specific early morning task sequences as these are ecosystems.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Found between "Close Drawer", "Close Dishwasher", and other maintenance tasks usually close strings of commands.
   - Highlighted during periods like 1340 ("Stand"), 1352 starting much of routine close operations Stretching defines hard limits but maybe something at 1337. Period 1335-1436 is somewhat ahead.

5. **Sandwich time**:
   - Activities around fridge operation, eating activities "Sit" are key.
   - Transition period around 1048 ("Walk" to "Open Fridge") may indicate food prepping for about 20 seconds among hints suggesting breaching from 1043 (incl 1047 order process overlaps probably)

Summarizing distinct periods welcomes deeper analysis, but generalized periods might include multi-tasking overlaps subtler than here approximated. Adjust durations upon confirming actual etiquettes or further context beyond datasets.
