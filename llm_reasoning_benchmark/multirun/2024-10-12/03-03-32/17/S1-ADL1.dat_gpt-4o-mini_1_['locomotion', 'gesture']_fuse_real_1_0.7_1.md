### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specific activity labeled "Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", "Cleanup", and "Sandwich time" based on the provided sensor data, we first note that the data does not include any of these activity labels. Instead, the activities in the dataset are:

- "Shake Hands"
- "Swim"
- "Stand"
- "Walk"
- "0"

Since we only have these activities, it is impossible to calculate durations for activities labeled "Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", "Cleanup", or "Sandwich time" because they do not appear in the recorded data.

For the activities present, we can define a methodology to calculate durations if you had specific timestamps for other activities or if there were specific activities you wanted to analyze. If you require duration calculations for the activities present in your dataset, please specify the activities of interest or provide any additional context that may be relevant for further analysis.
