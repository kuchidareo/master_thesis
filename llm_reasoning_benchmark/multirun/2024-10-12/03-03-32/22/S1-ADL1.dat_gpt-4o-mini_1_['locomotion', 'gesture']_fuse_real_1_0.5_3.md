### assistant
To analyze the provided sensor data and calculate the duration of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract the relevant activity entries** from the CSV.
2. **Group the entries by activity** and find the start and end times to calculate the duration for each activity.
3. **Sum the durations** for each activity accordingly.

However, based on the content you provided, none of the specified activities—Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time—seem to be present in the data. The CSV appears to contain activities like Swim, Walk, Stand, and Shake Hands.

Since we cannot directly compute durations for nonexistent activities, let’s instead illustrate how to calculate durations for the available activities in the data. 

### Calculation of Durations for Available Activities:

Assuming we want to calculate the duration of the `Swim` activity as an example, we can follow the next steps:

1. Gather all timestamps for the `Swim` activity.
2. Determine the time intervals between successive entries with the `Swim` label.
3. Calculate the total time spent in swimming.

Let's process this manually as an example:

- From the timestamps:
  - 92, 272, 302, 315, 319, 330, 336, 339, ... up to 1522.

We can observe that we only have seconds captured at various timestamps.

### Example of manual duration calculation for 'Swim':
We will calculate total time swim durations without getting specific start or end times for other activities:

- `Swim (92)` → `Swim (272)` (duration = 272 - 92 = 180 seconds)
- `Swim (272)` → `Swim (302)` (duration = 302 - 272 = 30 seconds)
- `Swim (302)` → `Swim (315)` (duration = 315 - 302 = 13 seconds)
 
Continuing this process for every instance of `Swim`, the total can be summed up accordingly.

### Applying this Method:
- Perform a similar breakdown for every other activity, if it exists in the dataset.

### Conclusion
Since `Relaxing`, `Coffee time`, `Early morning`, and `Cleanup` are not found in the provided data, you will not receive any durations for them unless you provide additional data. For the `Swim` activity, you can either write a script in Python to automate this summarization or methodically calculate as shown in a summary table format. 

**If you want detailed calculations or to analyze any other activity**, please provide relevant entries of those activities or share more data if available!
