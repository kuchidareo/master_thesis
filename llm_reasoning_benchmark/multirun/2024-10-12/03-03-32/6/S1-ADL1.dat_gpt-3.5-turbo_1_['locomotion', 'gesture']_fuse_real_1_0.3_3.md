### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we need to look at the timestamp data for each activity and calculate the time elapsed between the start and end of each activity. Below is a breakdown of the different activities and their durations:

1. Relaxing:
   - Start time: 0
   - End time: 1063
   - Duration: 1063 - 0 = 1063 seconds

2. Coffee time (Assuming that Coffee time corresponds to 'Drink from Cup'):
   - Start time: 850
   - End time: 855
   - Duration: 855 - 850 = 5 seconds

3. Early morning:
   - Start time: 92
   - End time: 243 (approximate based on the available data)
   - Duration: 243 - 92 = 151 seconds

4. Cleanup (Assuming that Cleanup corresponds to 'Close Drawer 2' and 'Close Door 1'):
   - Start time: 1010
   - End time: 1476
   - Duration: 1476 - 1010 = 466 seconds

5. Sandwich time (Assuming that Sandwich time corresponds to 'Open Fridge'):
   - Start time: 724
   - End time: 1469
   - Duration: 1469 - 724 = 745 seconds

These are the estimated durations for each of the specified activities based on the available data in the CSV file.
