### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we first need to extract and analyze the timestamps associated with each activity. However, from the data provided, it appears that the activities we're looking to analyze (i.e., Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) are not explicitly listed in the data.

The activities currently present in the dataset consist of:

- Swim
- Stand
- Walk
- Shake Hands

There are no entries specifically labeled "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," or "Cleanup." 

Since the file only lists "Swim," "Stand," "Walk," and "Shake Hands," we can calculate the duration for those activities instead. Let's go through the steps to calculate the duration of the recorded activities:

1. **Identify Unique Activities**: From the list, we can see that the following unique activities can be considered:
   - Swim
   - Stand
   - Walk
   - Shake Hands

2. **Calculate Duration**:
   To calculate the duration of each activity, we can:
   - Sort the timestamps for each activity.
   - Calculate the difference between the start and end timestamps for each unique activity.
   - Sum those differences to get the total duration for each activity.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each activity from the given data:

### Swim Duration Calculation:
1. **Extract timestamps** for all instances of "Swim".
2. **Calculate duration**:
   - First timestamp for "Swim" = 92
   - Last timestamp for "Swim" = 1504
   - Total Duration = Last timestamp - First timestamp.

### Stand Duration Calculation:
1. **Extract timestamps** for all instances of "Stand".
2. **Calculate duration**:
   - First timestamp for "Stand" = 302
   - Last timestamp for "Stand" = 1489
   - Total Duration = Last timestamp - First timestamp.

### Walk Duration Calculation:
1. **Extract timestamps** for all instances of "Walk".
2. **Calculate duration**:
   - First timestamp for "Walk" = 326
   - Last timestamp for "Walk" = 1522
   - Total Duration = Last timestamp - First timestamp.

### Shake Hands Duration Calculation:
1. **Extract timestamps** for all instances of "Shake Hands".
2. **Calculate duration**:
   - First timestamp for "Shake Hands" = 319
   - Last timestamp for "Shake Hands" = 1440
   - Total Duration = Last timestamp - First timestamp.

### Summary of Calculated Durations:
- **Swim Duration**: 1504 - 92 = 1412
- **Stand Duration**: 1489 - 302 = 1187
- **Walk Duration**: 1522 - 326 = 1196
- **Shake Hands Duration**: 1440 - 319 = 1121

Hence the total durations for the activities available are:
- Swim: 1412 seconds
- Stand: 1187 seconds
- Walk: 1196 seconds
- Shake Hands: 1121 seconds

Since there is no data on 'Relaxing', 'Coffee time', 'Early morning', or 'Cleanup', we cannot provide durations for those activities. If those activities were recorded as another form of label or combined with the existing activities, please provide that information for a more detailed analysis.
