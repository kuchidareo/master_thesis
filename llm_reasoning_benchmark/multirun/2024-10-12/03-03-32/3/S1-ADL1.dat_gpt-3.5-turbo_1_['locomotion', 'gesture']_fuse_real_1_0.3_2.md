### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we need to find the timestamps for the start and end of each activity. 

Here are the timestamps for each activity mentioned in the CSV provided:

- Relaxing: No specific label provided, cannot determine the timestamps.
- Coffee time: No specific label provided, cannot determine the timestamps.
- Early morning: No specific label provided, cannot determine the timestamps.
- Cleanup: No specific label provided, cannot determine the timestamps.
- Sandwich time: No specific label provided, cannot determine the timestamps.

Without specific labels or markers for the activities mentioned, it is not possible to accurately calculate the duration of each activity. If additional information or specific labels are provided, I can help analyze the data further.
