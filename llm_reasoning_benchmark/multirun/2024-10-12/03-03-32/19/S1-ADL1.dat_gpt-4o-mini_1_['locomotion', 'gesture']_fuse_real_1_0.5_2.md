### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time from the provided sensor label table, we first need to interpret the data.

### Understanding the Data
The data consists of three columns:
1. An activity label (which in this dataset includes activities like "Stand," "Walk," "Swim," and "Shake Hands").
2. A secondary label that often appears as "0" or other descriptors.
3. A timestamp (in seconds).

Given that the activities you're interested in—Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time—are not explicitly present in the dataset you provided, we will assess the common activities and their durations instead based on the timestamps.

### Step-by-step Approach

1. **Extract Timestamps**: We will create a list of unique timestamps for each activity.
2. **Calculate Activity Durations**: We will find the total time spent on each activity by taking the differences between consecutive timestamps belonging to that activity.
3. **Aggregate Results**: Combine the results to get the total duration for each identified activity.

### Sample Calculation
Let's calculate the durations of the identified activities. The provided CSV data should first be structured so that we can make these calculations.

Given some sample lines:
- For example, the first few lines read:
  - `0,Stand,92`
  - `0,Walk,261`
  - `0,Swim,272`
  
We need to create a dictionary of activities with their corresponding timestamps. 

After reviewing the data for each activity, we can calculate duration based on unique segments of non-identical activity types. 

### Example Calculation:

Below is a simple logic involving the pseudo-code to illustrate how one might implement this in a programming language like Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample data
data = """
0,Stand,92
0,Walk,261
0,Swim,272
0,Stand,302
0,Walk,315
0,Swim,319
... (more data)
"""

# Convert the data into a format we can work with
activity_durations = defaultdict(list)

for line in data.strip().split('\n'):
    label, activity, timestamp = line.split(',')
    timestamp = int(timestamp)
    activity_durations[activity].append(timestamp)

# Calculate durations
durations = {}
for activity, timestamps in activity_durations.items():
    if len(timestamps) > 1:
        total_duration = sum(timestamps[i] - timestamps[i - 1] 
                             for i in range(1, len(timestamps)))
        durations[activity] = total_duration

# Display results for each activity
for activity, duration in durations.items():
    print(f"{activity}: {duration} seconds")
```

### Results
Upon examining the data and running a similar calculation as above, we will receive total time spent on identified activities from recorded values.

#### Note:
Since the requirements only focused on activities that were not present in the raw dataset, ensure to align definitions of the activities with the actual data labels or reevaluate the sensor log in search of more relevant activities fitting those descriptions.

The above outline can guide you through processing the data and calculating the duration of activities based on unique identifiers. If you need any specific results for identified activities distinctly defined in the data, kindly clarify those activity types further!
