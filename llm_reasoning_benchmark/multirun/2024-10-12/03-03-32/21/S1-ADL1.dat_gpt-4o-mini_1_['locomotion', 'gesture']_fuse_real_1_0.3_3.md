### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we first need to extract the timestamps for each of the activities: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time from the sensor data you provided. 

However, upon reviewing the provided activity data, it seems like none of these specific activity labels (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) are present in the data. Here's an overview of the activities in the provided data:

- Swim
- Walk
- Stand
- Shake Hands
- Drink from Cup
- Open Fridge
- Close Fridge
- Open Door 1
- Close Door 1
- Close Door 2
- Clean Table

The only relevant activity that comes close to "Cleanup" could be "Clean Table," but the others (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, and Sandwich time) do not appear in the data.

### Based on the available activities, if we consider "cleanup" to mean "Clean Table", we can calculate its duration.

Now, letâ€™s go ahead and calculate the time duration for "Clean Table":

1. **Identify timestamps** where "Clean Table" occurs.
2. **Calculate the time span** between events.

#### Timestamps for "Clean Table":
- The timestamps where "Clean Table" appears:
    - Clean Table, Stand, 1440
    - Clean Table, 0, 1451
    - (Here, the 1451 timestamp is the end of the activity)

**Duration Calculation for "Clean Table"**:
- Start Time: 1440
- End Time: 1451

**Duration** = End Time - Start Time = 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds

### Result Summary:
- Clean Table (interpreted as "Cleanup"): Duration = 11 seconds

Since we do not have any mentions of "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," or "Sandwich time" in the provided data, we cannot calculate their durations.

If you have data regarding the other activities or need further analysis on the available activities, please share!
