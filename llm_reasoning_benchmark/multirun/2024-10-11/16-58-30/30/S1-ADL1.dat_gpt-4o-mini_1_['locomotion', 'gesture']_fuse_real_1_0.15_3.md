### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) from the given CSV file, we first need to identify the timestamps for these activities by examining the provided data. However, the entries do not directly mention the requested activities (e.g., "Relaxing," "Coffee time," etc.). 

Instead, we have to interpret what might correspond to these activities based on common behaviors:

1. **Relaxing**: This could correlate to "Stand" or "Sit" actions without significant movement. We could consider periods with frequent "Stand" or less activity.

2. **Coffee time**: Could be inferred from entries related to drinking (e.g., "Drink from Cup").

3. **Early morning**: This may involve morning activities such as preparing breakfast or similar routines, but there is no direct indication in the provided data.

4. **Cleanup**: The direct indications of a cleaning activity such as "Clean Table" should be considered here.

5. **Sandwich time**: This could potentially correlate with activities that involve food preparation or eating that are not explicitly logged.

### Analyzing Events for Cleanup and Drink from Cup

1. **Cleanup Activities**:
   - From the provided data, instances of "Clean Table":
     - **Start**: 1440 (Stand)
     - **End**: 1451 (0)
     - Duration: 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds.

Thus, total duration of the cleanup activity is **11 seconds**.

2. **Drink from Cup Activities**:
   - Instances of "Drink from Cup":
     - **Start**: 843 (Stand)
     - **Subsequent Activity**: 850 (Walk)
     - **End**: 851 (Stand)
     - Duration: 851 - 843 = 8 seconds.
   - Note that there are several entries for "Drink from Cup," but they fall within several seconds apart in overall time. However, we only consider the first occurrence as it represents a single continuous activity.

Thus, the total duration of drink from cup activity is **8 seconds**.

### Summary & Conclusion
Based on the data:
- Cleanup Activity Duration: **11 seconds**
- Coffee Time Duration: **8 seconds** 
- **Relaxing** and **Sandwich time** definitions were not clearly represented in the provided data.
- **Early Morning** was not identifiable either. 

If you need more specifics in terms of activities or have a certain set of activities worth checking, please clarify or provide further details.
