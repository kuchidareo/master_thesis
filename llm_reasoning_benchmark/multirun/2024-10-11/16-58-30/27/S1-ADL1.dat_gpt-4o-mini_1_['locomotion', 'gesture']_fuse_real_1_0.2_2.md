### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) from the provided log of human activities, we should first identify the timestamps corresponding to these specific activities, if they are present. 

It seems, though, that the CSV data does not include the defined activity labels like "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," and "Sandwich time." Instead, the data consists of different activities like "Walk," "Swim," "Stand," and other actions.

The only activity that has a slight resemblance to your query is "Clean Table," which might relate to “Cleanup.” Let's focus on that.

### Process
1. **Identify timestamps associated with "Clean Table."**
2. **Calculate the duration between the start and end of these activities.**

### Analyzing "Clean Table":
From the provided data:
- The activity "Clean Table" occurs at timestamp 1440.
- It remains active until timestamp 1451.

#### Duration Calculation:
- Start: 1440 
- End: 1451 

To calculate the duration:
\[ \text{Duration} = \text{End} - \text{Start} = 1451 - 1440 = 11 \text{ seconds} \]

### Output: 
- **Cleanup Activity (Clean Table):** 11 seconds

### Summary:
The provided data had no record of "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," or "Sandwich time." The only related activity found was "Clean Table," which lasted for **11 seconds**. If there are specific timestamps or activities related to those queried, please provide more detailed data for analysis.
