### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we need to analyze the timestamps and transitions between activities from the provided data. Here are the durations for the specified activities:

Relaxing:
- Starts at timestamp 0
- Ends at timestamp 336
- Duration = 336 - 0 = 336 seconds

Coffee time:
- Starts at timestamp 443
- Ends at timestamp 733
- Duration = 733 - 443 = 290 seconds

Early morning:
- There is no specific start and end timestamp provided for this activity. It seems to be a combination of various activities in the morning. 

Cleanup:
- Starts at timestamp 849
- Ends at timestamp 1451
- Duration = 1451 - 849 = 602 seconds

Sandwich time:
- Starts at timestamp 1490
- Ends at the end of the provided data
- Duration = End of data - 1490

Please note that the duration of "Early morning" is not clearly defined in the provided data as it seems to be a combination of various activities. If you need a more precise calculation for this activity, additional information or criteria for defining this activity may be needed.
