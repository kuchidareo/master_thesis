### assistant
To analyze the duration of each activity like Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time, we need to deduce they correspond to various sensor records (such as Open Fridge, Close Fridge, Toggle Switch, Shake Hands, Clean Table) typically linked with those activities. Below is a reasonable interpretation:

1. **Relaxing:** This might correspond to sequences with Stand, Sit, Lie without much movement (Walk or Swim).

2. **Coffee time:** Could involve Drink from Cup interactions and potentially using the Fridge or Cups.

3. **Early Morning:** This could include starting the day sequences like opening doors, toggling switches, the initial stand, and walk.

4. **Cleanup:** Likely when Clean Table or Open/Close Drawer interactions are seen. 

5. **Sandwich time:** Involves frequent Fridge accesses and possibly opening drawer actions.

Letâ€™s consider explicit durations based on these assumptions:

- **Relaxing:** Start from the initial sensor activity to where the first significant routine activity (like opening the fridge or drawers) begins, also potentially any period with the Sit label: 
  - Duration where people are typically Sit or Stand without interruptions (e.g., Stand: 392-878, Sit: 865-889).

- **Coffee time:** Look for Drink from Cup interactions:
  - From 843 to 851 and 862 to 885.

- **Early morning:** The first few interactions usually consisting of Walk, Stand, and early Swim. This could be around the initial set of activities:
  - Start at 0, up until significant activity commences such as Open Door 1 or Fridge or Drawer (0 to ~ 373).

- **Cleanup:** Observed when Clean Table and various drawer interactions happen:
  - Clean Table occurs around 1440, lasting a few cycles (1440 to 1456).

- **Sandwich time:** Activity involving Fridge interactions and possible opening drawers:
  - Open Fridge around 336 and significant activity is seen (like Open Door 1, Shake Hands) show food/drink handling (e.g., 336 overlaps with such scenarios all the way up to ~1423 or later).

Given that I cannot see explicit "begin and end" activities naturally defined in the dataset strictly matching all constraints directly:

- You would evaluate these events around deduced equivalences and use the data timestamps to compute when these activities have started or ended.
- Assuming all mentioned markers provide rough bounds, calculate the spread between timestamps.

This programming approach needs observation against logical deduction and typical use patterns.
Consider extrapolating these assumptions for final results with domain knowledge about which labels correlate directly to those defined activities.
