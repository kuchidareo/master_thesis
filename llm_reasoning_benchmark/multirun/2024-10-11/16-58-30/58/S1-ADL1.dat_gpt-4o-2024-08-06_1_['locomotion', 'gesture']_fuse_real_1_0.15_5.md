To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to first identify the sequences of events related to these activities. Let's analyze the data to find these patterns:

1. **Relaxing:** This might include combination of stands and walks with minimal interaction. In this data, there are frequent transitions between standing and walking, and possibly swimming. The likely matches are:
    - From the start to 336 (before "Open Fridge,Stand").
    - From 889 (after last swimming) to 907.
    - Other stand+walk cycles.

2. **Coffee Time:** This often involves interactions with a fridge and can include handshakes and cups (if any are mentioned). A speculative match might be:
    - 336 to 345 (before or after fridge entry).
    - 907 to 933 (second fridge entry).

3. **Early Morning:** In the absence of specific time stamps correlating to times of the day, let's hypothesize early morning as the first major sequence:
    - From start to around 345 (Open Fridge when a typical morning routine might involve getting what is needed for the day).

4. **Cleanup:** Might involve more structured sequences with shaking hands signal ending tasks, or consistent door/drawer interaction. Possible matches:
    - 1006 to 1071 (multiple drawer actions, suggests organization).
    - After multiple door actions around 1346.
  
5. **Sandwich Time:** Opening of doors and drawers might suggest this pattern. Consider:
    - From 1043 (Open Fridge) to 1051 (when fridge is closed).

To summarize, let's repurpose the specific patterns:

- **Relaxing:** Duration might be aggregate periods involving minimal 'action-trigger' events.
- **Coffee Time:** Could tie to interactions with the fridge around mornings and after the first break.
- **Early Morning:** Initial sequences up to first major interaction with a fridge or tabletop.
- **Cleanup:** Period with consecutive drawer-door events.
- **Sandwich Time:** Involves fridges and possibly ends after hands shake or similar signs.

Given these general guidelines, here is an effort to estimate durations:

1. **Relaxing:** Themes scattered, probably aggregates of the sequence when little interaction happens.
2. **Coffee Time:** ~9 minutes around fridge incidents.
3. **Early Morning:** ~5 minutes in the initial sequence.
4. **Cleanup:** ~20 minutes, inferred from grouped drawer/door activities.
5. **Sandwich Time:** Maybe a narrow period, about ~6-7 minutes around fridge and standing transitions.

This breakdown uses inferred human activities from sensor labels. Actual durations may differ based on nuances not evident in the provided data.
