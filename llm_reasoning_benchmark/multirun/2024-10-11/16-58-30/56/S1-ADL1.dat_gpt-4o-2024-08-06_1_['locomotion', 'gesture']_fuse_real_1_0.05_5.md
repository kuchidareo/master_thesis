### assistant
To calculate the duration of each labeled activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to first identify the start and end timestamps for each activity, based on the context provided by sensor labels. Here's how we can analyze the given sensor events:

### Analysis
1. **Relaxing:**
   - Typically involves minimal physical activity such as standing, sitting, or lying down.
   - From the dataset, between timestamps like 0 to 300, the activities mostly involve "Stand" and "Lie", suggesting a period of relaxing.
   - Relaxing period: 272 (Lie start) to 319 (Stand transition), resulting in 47 units of time.

2. **Coffee time:**
   - May involve interaction with kitchen appliances like a fridge or a coffee machine.
   - Around timestamps 335 to 345, there are "Open Fridge" and "Close Fridge" events, indicating activity around the kitchen.
   - Coffee time period: 336 (Open Fridge) to 343 (Close Fridge), resulting in 7 units of time.

3. **Early morning:**
   - Generally associated with activities preparing for the day.
   - The beginning of the dataset, from timestamps like 0 to 92, sees changes in activities (from Stand to Walk), and could be considered early morning routine.
   - Early morning period: 0 to 92, resulting in 92 units of time.

4. **Cleanup:**
   - Likely involves cleaning actions, observable from specific signals like "Clean Table".
   - At timestamps around 1440 to 1451, there is a "Clean Table" event observed.
   - Cleanup period: 1440 to 1451, resulting in 11 units of time over two segments.

5. **Sandwich time:**
   - May involve using kitchen appliances and some preparation activities.
   - Between timestamps 675 to 710, there is significant "Open/Close Fridge" and drawer events, indicating sandwich preparation.
   - Sandwich time period: 675 (Close Door) to close of preparation activities, maybe around 704 (Close Drawer), resulting in approximately 29 units of time.

### Summary of Durations

- Relaxing: 47 units of time.
- Coffee time: 7 units of time.
- Early morning: 92 units of time.
- Cleanup: 11 units of time.
- Sandwich time: ~29 units of time.

This analysis reflects an estimate based on contextual identification of activities from the given events. The exact duration could vary slightly based on further data or detailed event contexts.
