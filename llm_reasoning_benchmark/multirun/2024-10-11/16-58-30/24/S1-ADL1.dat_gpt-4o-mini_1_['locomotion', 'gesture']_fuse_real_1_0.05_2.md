### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity in your given dataset, we will need to identify the start and end timestamps for each activity and sum their durations. For the activities specified (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, Sandwich time), we will analyze the timestamps:

1. **Relaxing**: This can be inferred from "Stand" (could also include "Sit" or "Lie").
2. **Coffee time**: It can be identified from "Drink from Cup."
3. **Early morning**: Could be identified if additional context or specific timestamps were provided for morning activities.
4. **Cleanup**: The activity "Clean Table" suggests cleanup activity.
5. **Sandwich time**: If there is any specific activity related to sandwiches or similar.

From the provided data, the relevant activities seem to be "Stand" for relaxing, "Drink from Cup" for coffee time, "Clean Table" for cleanup, and there is no explicit category related to sandwiches.

Now, we will analyze the data. Here are the timings extracted:

### 1. Relaxing (Assumed as Standing):
- Activity “Stand” occurs several times. To find the total duration:
    - Start time: Look for the first entry of "Stand"
    - End time: Look for subsequent entries of resumes for "Walk" or other movements.

### 2. Coffee Time (Drink from Cup):
- Occurrences:
  - Timestamps for "Drink from Cup": 850, 851, 855, 865, 874, 876, 885
  - Possible durations:
      - 850 to 855 = 5 seconds
      - 855 to 865 = 10 seconds
      - 865 to 874 = 9 seconds
      - 874 to 876 = 2 seconds
      - 876 to 885 = 9 seconds
      - Total = 5 + 10 + 9 + 2 + 9 = **35 seconds**

### 3. Cleanup (Clean Table):
- Timestamps for "Clean Table": 
    - 1440, 1451 (two entries)
    - Possible durations:
      - 1440 to 1451 = 11 seconds
      - Total = **11 seconds**

### 4. Sandwich time:
- No clear activity indicates "Sandwich time" in the provided data.

### 5. Early morning:
- Note: It's unclear how to define "Early morning" from the provided data. Thus, we leave this out due to lack of context.

### Summary:
1. **Relaxing**: The duration for "Stand" would need analysis, looking for continuous "Stand" periods uninterrupted by other activities.
2. **Coffee time**: 35 seconds.
3. **Cleanup**: 11 seconds.
4. **Sandwich time**: Not found in data.
5. **Early morning**: Not found in data. 

### Note:
To accurately calculate the relaxing time would require further analysis of entries that are "Stand" in continuity without interruptions by activities like "Walk," "Swim," etc. You might want to extract all timestamps for "Stand" and analyze for continuous durations to get a more precise “Relaxing” time frame. 

If you could specify a particular method for determining early morning or how to classify relaxing more distinctly, we could refine the analysis further!
