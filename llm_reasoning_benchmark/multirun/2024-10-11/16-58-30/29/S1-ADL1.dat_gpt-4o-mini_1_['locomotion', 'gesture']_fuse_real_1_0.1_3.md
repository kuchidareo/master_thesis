### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) from the provided sensor label table, we need to examine the timestamps associated with these activities and compute how long each of them lasted.

Given the data provided, it appears that the activities that are mentioned (like "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," and "Sandwich time") do not seem to directly appear in your provided CSV log. Instead, the existing log consists of various sensor readings like "Stand", "Walk", "Swim", "Open Fridge", "Shake Hands", and "Close Door".

However, we do have one activity that can be categorized as a "Cleanup" - "Clean Table." 

Here's how we can find the duration for that activity:

1. Identify all the timestamps associated with "Clean Table".
2. Calculate the difference between the timestamps where the activity begins and where it ends.

### Extracting "Clean Table" activity
From the provided data, the "Clean Table" activity appears as follows:
- **Start**: Clean Table, Stand, **Timestamp: 1440**
- **End**: Clean Table, X (could be either Stand/Walk), **Timestamp: 1451** 

### Calculating Duration
- **Duration of Clean Table**:
  - Start Time: 1440
  - End Time: 1451
  - Duration = End Time - Start Time = 1451 - 1440 = **11 seconds**

### Summary of Activities:
To summarize, from the available data we could only identify and calculate the duration of the "Clean Table" activity as follows:

- **Cleanup (Clean Table)**: 11 seconds

Unfortunately, there are no entries in the data for "Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", or "Sandwich time". If additional context or data is available for these activities, please provide it, and I would be happy to assist further!
