### assistant
To analyze the provided sensor data and calculate the durations for specified activities ("Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", "Cleanup", and "Sandwich time"), we must first define which labels correspond to these activities in the context of the given CSV data. However, the provided data does not specify these activities directly.

Based on common interpretations:
- "Relaxing" could be represented by periods of standing or sitting with no other actions.
- "Coffee time" could be indicated by instances of drinking from a cup (as seen in the provided data).
- "Early morning" isn't clearly defined in the data either, but could be interpreted as morning routines or activities happening right after a certain time.
- "Cleanup" would relate to activities involving cleaning or organizing, such as "Clean Table".
- "Sandwich time" might relate to activities around preparing or consuming a sandwich, though none are explicitly mentioned in the provided data.

Given the activities identified in your CSV, we will track the duration of the activities based on their timestamps.

### Steps to Calculate Durations:
1. **Extract Relevant Entries** for isolated activity durations (assuming any unrelated activities immediately surrounding are skipped).
2. **Calculate Duration** based on timestamps, identifying start and end times of relevant key activities.
3. **Aggregate and Analyze Durations** for relevant activities accordingly.

Let's break down how we would do this for the recognized activities based on available timestamps.

**Identified Relevant Activities**:
- **Drinking from Cup** (Coffee time)
- **Cleaning Table** (Cleanup)
- We need to infer the other activities based on the potential use-case descriptions or look for patterns in the dataset.

### Example Calculation for **Clean Table**:
- First Detection: `Clean Table,Stand,1440`
- Last Detection: `Clean Table,Stand,1451`

**Duration Calculation**:
- Start: 1440
- End: 1451
- Duration = End - Start = 1451 - 1440 = **11 seconds** for "Clean Table".

### Example for **Drinking from Cup** (Coffee time):
- First Detection: `Drink from Cup,Stand,843`
- Last Detection: `Drink from Cup,Sit,876`

**Duration Calculation**:
- Start: 843
- End: 876
- Duration = End - Start = 876 - 843 = **33 seconds** for "Drink from Cup".

### Summary of Findings:
In this activity log data, without explicit labels corresponding to "Relaxing", "Early morning", or "Sandwich time", we would only effectively calculate durations for the "Coffee time" and "Cleanup" based on direct action mentions (Drinking from Cup and Clean Table).

**To execute the calculations comprehensively**, we would iterate through the dataset, tracking timestamps and categorizing based on identified activities.

### Final Duration Report:
- **Coffee Time (Drink from Cup)**: 33 seconds
- **Cleanup (Clean Table)**: 11 seconds
- **Relaxing**: Needs explicit identification from context (may be a sum of Standing/Sitting intervals devoid of other activity).
- **Early Morning**: Undefined in context from data provided.
- **Sandwich Time**: Undefined in context from data provided. 

Follow similar approaches to calculate any potential durations based on specified starting and ending time ranges from the CSV input.
