### assistant
To calculate the duration of the activities mentioned (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to identify the timestamp ranges that correspond to each activity from the sensor labels. However, the CSV provided doesn't explicitly mention these activities by name. We must infer these activities from the surrounding context or existing routine descriptions.

1. **Relaxing**: This could be associated with standing or sitting quietly, potentially seen here with `Stand` and `Sit` activities. We would look for long periods with minimal activity.
2. **Coffee time**: This could involve `Drink from Cup` events surrounded by less movement.
3. **Early morning**: This might involve opening doors or fridge and initial activities such as making breakfast or a morning routine.
4. **Cleanup**: Activities that include `Clean Table` or interactions with household items like dishwashers.
5. **Sandwich time**: Likely associated with `Open Fridge` and some interaction with drawers or counters, typically involving `Stand` or `Walk`.

Let's go through the timeline to pinpoint these activities:

- **Relaxing**: 
  - From `Stand, 678` to activities before `Open Fridge, Swim, 907` with minimal movement.
    - Duration: 678 to 907 = 229 units
  
- **Coffee time**:
  - Sequence starts with `Open Fridge` (at 907) to `Drink from Cup` activities ending around 862 to 885.
    - Duration: 907 to a little after 851 (adjust to correct for discrepancy around standing) = Roughly 50 units

- **Early morning**:
  - This might begin with the earliest activity sequences from either `Open Door 2`, `Open Fridge` sequences or a conscious start boundary around movements post initial periods of `0,Stand`.
  - Rough guess in context might say start around `Close Door 2,0,427` and runs till `Open Fridge` around 700.
    - Duration: Senior guess within event sequences 0 and inferred activities, lets estimate around 400 

- **Cleanup**:
  - Follow `Clean Table,Stand,1440` events until movements below `Clean Table,0,1451`.
    - Starts effectively spot-on the clean table events and finishes its trend around door.
    - Duration: 11 units (1440 to 1451 before sane switch).

- **Sandwich time**:
  - Begin possibly with `Open Fridge` around series of fridge to immediate drawer follows; likely lasting along one full expansion of changing activities back down.
  - Open `Fridge from 1043`, line it until `Open Drawer` reflections complete except expect strong focus around momentary ends after sets like `1240s` have tranquil backfields.
    - Duration: Approximately minor pull line 25-30, entry aggregation reads near distinguish related items.

Remember, these breakdowns are educated guesses based on activity labels, and additional contextual understanding could improve the accuracy. Activities overlap can be an assumption, especially without set contextual timestamps labeled explicitly.
