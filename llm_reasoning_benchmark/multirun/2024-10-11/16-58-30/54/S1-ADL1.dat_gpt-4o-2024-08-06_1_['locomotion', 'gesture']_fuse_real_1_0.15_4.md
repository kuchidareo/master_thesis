### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), I'll first determine when those activities occur based on the provided data. Since the labels given don't directly correspond to those activities, we need to interpret them based on the context or any underlying pattern that may suggest which set of actions corresponds to each activity.

The given sensor labels correspond to various actions or states, but they don't clearly specify which action belongs to which activity (e.g., Relaxing, Coffee time, etc.). Without explicit mappings from sensor labels to activities, I'll make reasonable assumptions about the activities based on typical contexts in which certain actions occur.

1. **Relaxing**: We might assume that "Stand" or "Sit" over a long, continuous period can correspond to relaxing.

2. **Coffee time**: "Drink from Cup" likely indicates this activity.

3. **Early morning**: Could involve a series of actions typically done when starting the day; perhaps includes a combination of walking, opening doors/fridges, etc.

4. **Cleanup**: Likely to involve activities like "Clean Table" or repetitive movements.

5. **Sandwich time**: Could be associated with sequences of opening and closing fridges, drawers, or making sandwiches.

Now, I'll calculate the duration for each activity based on typical assumptions:

### 1. **Relaxing:**
   - Prevailing states of "Stand" or "Sit" for extended periods without much walking or swimming.
   - From timestamp 843 to 885: Drink from Cup (stand/sit) could suggest relaxation. Duration is 42 units.
   - Total Relaxing time: 42 units.

### 2. **Coffee Time:**
   - Directly indicated by "Drink from Cup".
   - Duration: from timestamp 843 to 851. Duration is 8 units.

### 3. **Early Morning:**
   - Early sequence of transitioning between different states/actions.
   - Let's assume it starts with morning activities, possibly from the beginning of the data up to the first clear activity break around early 400s.
   - From timestamp 0 to 447 (before extended stand period starts) could be considered. Duration is 447 units.

### 4. **Cleanup:**
   - Indicated by "Clean Table".
   - From timestamp 1440 to 1451. Duration is 11 units.

### 5. **Sandwich Time:**
   - Likely involves a sequence of actions typically requiring multiple objects (fridge, drawers), so potentially where these actions appear together repeatedly.
   - From timestamp 709 to 749 where multiple operations close to dinner/lunchtime occur. Duration is 40 units.

These interpretations are assumptions based on activity labels given the context. Without exact mapping from labels to activities, this remains speculative.
