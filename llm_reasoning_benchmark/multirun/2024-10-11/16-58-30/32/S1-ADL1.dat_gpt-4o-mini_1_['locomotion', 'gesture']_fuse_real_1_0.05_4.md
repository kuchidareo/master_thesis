### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) based on the sensor data provided, we first need to identify the timestamps for each activity and then compute the duration based on those timestamps.

Let's analyze the provided data:

1. **Relaxing**: 
   - From the activities labeled, we need to identify "Sit" and "Lie" activities which can be considered related to relaxation.
   - The "Sit" and "Lie" timestamps in the data are:
     - "Sit" at timestamp 862
     - "Sit" at timestamp 865
     - "Sit" at timestamp 876
     - "Sit" at timestamp 885
     - "Lie" at timestamp 272
     - "Lie" at timestamp 1504
   - **Duration Calculation**:
     - The last "Sit" activity overlaps with the "Lie" activity which interrupts it. Thus, consider the periods of continuous sit/lie as relaxing.
     - The total duration for relaxation can then be considered from the earliest timestamp of "Sit" to the last "Lie".
     
2. **Coffee time**: 
   - We look for the term "Drink from Cup", which appears multiple times:
     - Drink from Cup at timestamps 843, 850, 851, 855.
   - **Duration Calculation**:
     - These timestamps suggest continuous or segmented periods of coffee time.
     - The duration can be calculated from the first to the last activity involving "Drink from Cup" (843 to 876).

3. **Early morning**: 
   - Early morning may not have a specific entry but could relate to the first few activities of the day. We need contextual understanding of time if not clearly labeled in the data.
   
4. **Cleanup**: 
   - The term "Clean Table" suggests cleanup activity.
   - Appears at timestamps 1440, 1451.
   - The duration can be calculated as the difference between the first and last timestamp related to cleaning.

5. **Sandwich time**: 
   - There may not be direct entries related to "Sandwich time" unless it's indicated by activities such as "Eat" or similar. Thus, we may not be able to compute this unless specified differently.

Next, let's compute the durations:

### Relaxing Duration Calculation:
- Last "Sit" until the first "Lie": 
  - 862 to 1504.
  - Duration: 1504 - 862 = 642 seconds

### Coffee Time Duration Calculation:
- First "Drink from Cup" until the last:
  - 843 to 876.
  - Duration: 876 - 843 = 33 seconds

### Cleanup Duration Calculation:
- First "Clean Table" to the last:
  - 1440 to 1451.
  - Duration: 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds
  
### Summary of Calculated Durations:
- **Relaxing**: 642 seconds
- **Coffee time**: 33 seconds
- **Cleanup**: 11 seconds
- **Sandwich time**: Not available

The "Early morning" and "Sandwich time" were considered contextually but require substantial assumptions and sequences not present in given data. Each duration is based on identifying the earliest and latest capturing of related activities.
