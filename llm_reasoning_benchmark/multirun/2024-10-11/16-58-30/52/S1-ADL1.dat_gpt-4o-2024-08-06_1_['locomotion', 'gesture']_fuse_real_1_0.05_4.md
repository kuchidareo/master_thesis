### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we need to determine the start and end times for each of the specified activities in the dataset. We'll identify the start and end timestamps for each activity, then calculate the difference to find the duration.

Let's analyze the data:

### Relaxing
The activity "Relaxing" does not explicitly appear in the CSV data as a label. However, we might infer "Relaxing" from periods of inactivity or certain other labels like "Sit" or "Lie." We'll need to define a logic or criteria to estimate this.

### Coffee time
The activity "Coffee time" can be inferred from the actions involving a cup. The sequence "Drink from Cup" is seen in the data:
- Starts at timestamp 843, continues at 850, 851, 855, 865, 874, 876.
- Ends at the closest timestamp after last "Drink from Cup" visible action which is after 885 (when it transitions to "Swim").

To calculate the duration of "Coffee time," we consider the start at 843 and end logically determined by inactivity in interacting with the drink at 885. Therefore, duration = 885 - 843 = 42.

### Early morning
This activity label is not directly present in the dataset. If we assume "Early morning" activities occur from the lowest timestamp to a reasonable morning time boundary, we may take the starting timestamp (0) to a later timestamp in the morning, usually before significant activities start, say around 500:
- Start = 0
- End = around 500
- Duration = 500 - 0 = 500.

### Cleanup
"Cleanup" might be associated with actions such as "Clean Table." 
- We have explicit "Clean Table" label starting from 1440 to 1451.
- Therefore, duration = 1451 - 1440 = 11.

### Sandwich time
"Sandwich time" is not explicitly labeled, but could correlate with "Open Fridge" followed by relevant actions:
- Consider the possible sequence Open Fridge interactions such as: timestamps 336-343, 723-733, 1043-1047, and 1313-1326.
- Selecting any of these periods as potential sandwich preparation times.

An inferred sequence, e.g., 1043 (Open Fridge) to 1047 (Close Fridge) points to "Sandwich time."
- Duration = 1047 - 1043 = 4.

Thus, estimated durations based on labeled tasks from the dataset are:
- Relaxing: (inferred, needs clear logic)
- Coffee time: 42
- Early morning: 500
- Cleanup: 11
- Sandwich time: 4

Please note, for full accuracy, additional context or explicit labels are preferred, or actual scenarios assumed from given actions.
