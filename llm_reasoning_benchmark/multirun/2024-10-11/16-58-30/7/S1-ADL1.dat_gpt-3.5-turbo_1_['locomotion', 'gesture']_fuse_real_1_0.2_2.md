To calculate the duration of each activity mentioned (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to identify the start and end timestamps for each activity and then calculate the duration by subtracting the start time from the end time.

Based on the provided sensor labels, it seems that the activities listed are not directly labeled in the data, but we can try to infer the activities based on the sensor labels provided. Here is an analysis of the sensor labels to identify potential activities:

1. **Relaxing**: This activity could be inferred from sensor labels such as "Stand," "Sit," or "Swim," as these activities might indicate a state of relaxation. Duration could be calculated based on the timestamps for these labels.

2. **Coffee time**: Since the specific activity of drinking coffee might not be directly labeled, we can look for actions such as "Open Fridge" or "Drink from Cup" that could potentially be associated with coffee time.

3. **Early morning**: This might be a bit challenging to infer directly from the sensor labels provided unless there are specific actions or routines that are always done in the early morning hours.

4. **Cleanup**: This activity could be related to actions like "Close Drawer," "Close Door," "Clean Table," and similar actions that indicate tidying up or organizing.

5. **Sandwich time**: Similar to coffee time, this activity might not be explicitly labeled, but actions like opening the fridge, opening drawers (for ingredients), or specific eating actions could be associated with sandwich time.

By analyzing the sensor label data and looking for patterns in the actions recorded at different timestamps, we can infer the durations of the mentioned activities. If there are specific patterns or sequences related to these activities that are known in the context in which the data was collected, that information could be used to more accurately identify and calculate the durations of each activity.
