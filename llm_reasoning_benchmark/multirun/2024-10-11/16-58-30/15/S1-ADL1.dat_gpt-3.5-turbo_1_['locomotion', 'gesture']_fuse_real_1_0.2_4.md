### assistant
Based on the data provided, we can calculate the duration of each activity as follows:

1. Relaxing: 
We can consider all instances where the activity label is "Stand" as Relaxing. By analyzing the timestamps when "Stand" activity starts and ends, we can calculate the duration.

2. Coffee time: 
This activity is not explicitly labeled in the data provided. We can assume that any activity related to opening or closing the fridge or drinking from a cup can be considered as "Coffee time".

3. Early morning: 
This activity can be identified by looking at the timestamps that fall in the early morning time range (e.g., 6:00 AM - 8:00 AM).

4. Cleanup: 
We can identify the Cleanup activity by looking for specific actions like "Cleaning Table".

5. Sandwich time: 
This activity is not explicitly labeled in the data provided. We can assume that any activity related to opening drawers or doors might be associated with "Sandwich time".

By analyzing the timestamps and activities in the given data, we can calculate the duration of each of the mentioned activities.
