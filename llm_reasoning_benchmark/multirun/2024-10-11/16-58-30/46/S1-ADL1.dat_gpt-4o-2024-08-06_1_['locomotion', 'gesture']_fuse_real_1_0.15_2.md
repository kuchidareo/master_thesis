### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity, we need to identify timestamps that pertain to the activities we're interested in: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time. However, the CSV file you provided doesn't explicitly label these activities. From the provided data, I'll use some pattern inference to correlate activities like "Open Fridge", "Close Fridge", "Drink from Cup", "Clean Table", "Open Dishwasher", and "Close Dishwasher" with possible human activities that match within these labels.

Given that the data doesn't clearly label these activities explicitly, we will proceed based on assumptions:

1. **Relaxing** - Assumed when a person is mostly standing.
2. **Coffee time** - Assumed when "Drink from Cup" label appears.
3. **Early morning** - Not directly identifiable; could be the period with the most idle/stand periods early on.
4. **Cleanup** - Assumed by actions related to cleaning, such as "Clean Table".
5. **Sandwich time** - Assumed by actions like "Open Fridge" or "Close Fridge" for meal prep.

Let's enumerate based on action start and end time differences:

1. **Coffee time**:
   - Drink from Cup actions: 
     - Starts at timestamp 843, ends at 855.
     - Duration: 855 - 843 = 12 seconds.

2. **Cleanup**:
   - Clean Table actions:
     - Starts at 1440, ends at 1451.
     - Duration: 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds.
   - Additional cleanup gestures might be inferred from "Open Dishwasher", "Close Dishwasher", etc., but those are too sparse or indirectly relatable without explicit labeling.

3. **Sandwich time**:
   - "Open Fridge" to "Close Fridge" spans of time:
     - Opening and closing actions from 723 to 733: Duration 10 seconds.
     - Opening and closing actions from 1043 to 1048: Duration 5 seconds.
     - Opening and closing actions from 1313 to 1328: Duration 15 seconds.
   - Total for Sandwich time: 10 + 5 + 15 = 30 seconds.

4. **Relaxing**:
   - Not directly identifiable with the given data—often periods with long "Stand" durations that don’t distinctly lead to actions—However, without explicit information, estimating this would require more context on period detection.

5. **Early Morning**:
   - The CSV doesn't have time-of-day data, just moments; difficult to differentiate an "early morning" period without more extensive timelines or explicit markers for the start of a day's routine.

Thus, without named labels for each activity directly, calculating the durations as above involves assumption-based deductions. In practical scenarios, the distinct activity markers or additional metadata would lead to more definitive categorization and calculation.
