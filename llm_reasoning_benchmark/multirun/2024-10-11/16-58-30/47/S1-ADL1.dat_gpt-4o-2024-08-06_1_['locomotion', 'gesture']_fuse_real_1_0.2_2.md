### assistant
To analyze and calculate the duration of each specified activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, Sandwich time), I will have to make some assumptions since your data does not explicitly label these activities. Instead, I'll infer them based on typical human activities associated with each label as follows:

1. **Relaxing**: Assume associated with "Sit" or "Stand" within prolonged stationary periods.
2. **Coffee time**: Inferred around activities involving "Drink from Cup" and "Sit".
3. **Early morning**: Assume this might be associated with household activities like "Open Door", "Close Door", "Open Fridge", "Close Fridge" along with "Stand" or "Walk".
4. **Cleanup**: Inferred from activities like "Open Drawer", "Close Drawer", "Open Dishwasher", "Close Dishwasher", "Clean Table".
5. **Sandwich time**: Could involve "Open Fridge", "Close Fridge", and "Stand" for a short duration.

I will go through the CSV data to identify segments of timestamps that correspond to these activities and calculate their durations based on continuity or repetitive patterns.

### Steps:

1. **Relaxing**:
    - Periods of "Sit" :
        - From timestamp 862 to 885: 23 seconds.
        - From timestamp 1109 to 1311: 202 seconds.
    - Total Relaxing duration = 23 + 202 = 225 seconds.

2. **Coffee time**:
    - Presence of "Drink from Cup":
        - From timestamp 865 to 874 while "Sit": 9 seconds.
    - Assumed Coffee time duration = 9 seconds.

3. **Early morning**:
    - Activities such as "Open/Close Door", "Open/Close Fridge" mixed with "Stand" or "Walk" around early timestamps:
        - From timestamp 0 to 447: General morning activities (Open Fridge, Open/Close doors), analyzed duration = 447 seconds.
  
4. **Cleanup**:
    - Activities like "Open/Close Drawer" or "Dishwasher" or "Clean Table":
        - From timestamp 1338 to 1382: Open/Close Dishwasher - 44 seconds.
        - At 1401 to 1414 (Open/Close Drawers) - 13 seconds.
        - At 1440 to 1452 (Clean Table) - 12 seconds.
    - Total Cleanup duration = 44 + 13 + 12 = 69 seconds.

5. **Sandwich time**:
    - Likely involves fridge interaction and is short:
        - Timestamp ranges with "Open Fridge" followed by "Stand":
        - Example around timestamp 723 involving fridge actions + stand: Assume Sandwich could have happened within 723 - 735: 12 seconds.
    - Total Sandwich time duration = 12 seconds.

### Summary:

- **Relaxing**: 225 seconds.
- **Coffee time**: 9 seconds.
- **Early morning**: 447 seconds.
- **Cleanup**: 69 seconds.
- **Sandwich time**: 12 seconds.

These times are inferred based on the labeled activities and may not exactly correspond to human-interpreted activities without more specific contextual labels.
