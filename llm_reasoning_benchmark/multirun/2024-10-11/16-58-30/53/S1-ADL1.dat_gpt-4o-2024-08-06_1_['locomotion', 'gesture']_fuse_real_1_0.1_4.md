### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity, we need to determine the time intervals for each activity based on the sensor labels and timestamps provided. However, the CSV data you've provided does not contain explicit activity labels such as "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," or "Sandwich time." To proceed, I'll need to make some assumptions based on common activities associated with certain sensor labels. Here's a rough analysis:

1. **Relaxing**: This might correspond to 
    - periods of "Stand" or "Sit" without associated actions like "Open" or "Close."
2. **Coffee time**: This could involve activities related to the "Open Fridge" sensor.
3. **Early morning**: Since there is no direct time of day given in the data, this might involve the first set of activities noted since there's no direct timestamp to convey morning.
4. **Cleanup**: Activities involving "Open/Close Drawer", "Clean Table", and "Open/Close Dishwasher" are likely to be associated with cleanup.
5. **Sandwich time**: Similar to coffee time, could involve "Open Fridge" as well as some walking or standing right after.

I'll parse through the data considering the assumptions above:

### Analysis:

1. **Relaxing**:
   - Primarily involves periods where actions don't involve using any items i.e., mostly "Stand" or "Sit." However, because "Stand" appears almost continuously, we assume extended periods without interaction-focused actions.
   - Calculate intervals where there are contrasting "Open/Close/Toggling/Clean" actions apart from "Stand."

2. **Coffee time**:
   - Look for intervals where the timestamp involves opening the fridge and potentially drinking.

3. **Early morning**:
   - Given that timestamps do not provide day segments, we'll assume the initial activities until the first substantial interaction forms this segment.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Identified by specific "Open/Close Drawer", "Dishwasher", and "Clean Table" actions.

5. **Sandwich time**:
   - Overlaps with "Open Fridge" actions but might involve subsequent actions indicating sandwich preparation.

### Duration Calculation:
Applying these associations:

1. **Relaxing**: 
   - Look for gaps between multiple actions mainly involving "Stand" or "Sit."

2. **Coffee time**: 
   - E.g., `Open Fridge` at timestamps: 336, 443, 907, 1313, 1043, track associated nearby actions for plausible conclusion.

3. **Early morning (Initial sequence)**:
   - Activities from the beginning until the first distinctive door/fridge opening.

4. **Cleanup**: 
   - E.g., "Open Drawer", "Close Drawer", "Open/Close Dishwasher", "Clean Table"
   - Timestamps: 383-385, 702-706, 1338-1382 for drawers and dishwasher.

5. **Sandwich time (near fridge open)**:
   - E.g., After initial "Open Fridge" actions followed by movement actions, possibly marking complete prep time.

### Approximate Calculations:
Given the looseness of the assumptions, exact match might be difficult without clearer activity-specific labels and timestamps suggesting exact time portions (e.g., early morning) or further context.

If you require precise intervals, please clarify flagged activities or timestamps that can precisely indicate each activity type. Otherwise, the described assumption-analysis can provide rough time segments based on described sensor activity.
