### assistant
To compute the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to identify the relevant timestamps for these activities in the provided data.

Unfortunately, the provided data does not contain any explicit labels for "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," or "Sandwich time." Instead, there are labels like "Clean Table," "Drink from Cup," and "Stand," "Walk," etc. 

### Here's what we can do:
1. **Identify activities that might represent the specified activities:**
   - "Relaxing" could relate to periods of "Stand" without much movement.
   - "Coffee time" might relate to "Drink from Cup."
   - "Early morning" isn't directly specified but could involve morning-related activities before a certain timestamp.
   - "Cleanup" could relate to "Clean Table."
   - "Sandwich time" isn't specifically mentioned but could relate to any food-related actions.

2. **Calculate the durations:**
   We will sum up the time for the sequences of timestamps that might fit into the identified categories.

### Activity Analysis:

1. **Cleanup (e.g., Clean Table)**:
   - Activities: 
     - Clean Table, Swim, 1440
     - Clean Table, 0, 1451
     - Clean Table, Stand, 1451
     - Duration: 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds (between first Clean Table entry and the last)
  
2. **Coffee Time (e.g., Drink from Cup)**:
   - Activities:
     - Drink from Cup, Stand, 843
     - Drink from Cup, 0, 850
     - Drink from Cup, Stand, 851
     - Drink from Cup, Swim, 855
     - Drink from Cup, Sit, 865
     - Drink from Cup, Sit, 876
   - Duration: 876 - 843 = 33 seconds
  
3. **Relaxing**:
   - This could be hard to quantify with the available data. Assuming every Stand instance is "Relaxing": 
   - Count the total time spent standing between actions.
   - Stand clusters: 
     - From `Stand, 678` to `Stand, 679` (1s)
     - From `Stand, 701` to `Stand, 702` (1s)
     - Additional stands not interfering with other activities.
  
4. **Sandwich Time**: 
   - Not explicitly labeled. Canâ€™t calculate.

5. **Early Morning**: 
   - Not specified, but we can relate to earlier timestamps before a certain number. 

### Final Summary:
- **Cleanup**: 11 seconds
- **Coffee Time**: 33 seconds
- **Relaxing**: Hard to estimate; total time of Stand can give a better idea; approximately several instances summed could be counted.
- **Sandwich Time**: Unavailable.
- **Early morning**: Unavailable.

If you want a more precise definition for any activity or verify if they fit into specific categorical activities, please provide additional context or specific definitions to analyze further.
