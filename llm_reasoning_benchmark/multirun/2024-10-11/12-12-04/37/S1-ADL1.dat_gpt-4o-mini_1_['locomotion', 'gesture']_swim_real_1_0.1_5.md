### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specific activity, we begin by identifying timestamps of the start and end for each of the listed activities: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time. However, these activities aren't explicitly labeled in the provided dataset, so we may have to infer them or label them based on surrounding activity.

In the dataset, the timestamps are in seconds and represent when each activity was recorded. We can look for common activities that might correspond to the specified labels based on timeframes of recurring activities and assume the continuity of nearby actions. 

### Summary of Actions:
1. **Relaxing (typically involves sitting quietly)** might include activities labeled as 'Sit' with reasonable duration between other activities.
2. **Coffee time (often observed with actions like 'Drink from Cup')** might involve looking for multiple records of 'Drink from Cup'.
3. **Early morning (possibly indicated by lower overall activity, maybe 'Stand' or 'Sit' activities)**.
4. **Cleanup (actions like "Clean Table")** can be initiated by explicit labels.
5. **Sandwich time** isn't directly evident but may correlate with 'Sit' and standing around lunchtime.

### Let's analyze the data based on the clues:
- **Coffee Time** is largely represented by occurrences of 'Drink from Cup'.
- **Cleanup** corresponds directly to the 'Clean Table' actions.

### Calculation:
To identify the duration for the activities, we can look at timestamps where a particular activity begins and ends. 

### Process:
- We’ll iterate through the data and track times on a per-activity basis. 
- We’ll sum total seconds for durations corresponding to our derived activities.

#### Raw Calculation Code (Pseudocode):
```python
activity_durations = {
    'Relaxing': 0,
    'Coffee time': 0,
    'Early morning': 0,
    'Cleanup': 0,
    'Sandwich time': 0
}

# Iterate through the dataset
for i in range(len(data)-1):
    current_activity = data[i][1]
    next_activity = data[i+1][1]
    timestamp_current = data[i][0]
    timestamp_next = data[i+1][0]
    
    # Coffee Time accumulation
    if current_activity == 'Drink from Cup':
        activity_durations['Coffee time'] += (timestamp_next - timestamp_current)

    # Cleanup activity accumulation
    if current_activity == 'Clean Table':
        if next_activity == 'Clean Table':
            activity_durations['Cleanup'] += (timestamp_next - timestamp_current)

    # Relaxing as Sit duration
    if current_activity == 'Sit':
        activity_durations['Relaxing'] += (timestamp_next - timestamp_current)
    
    # Early Morning assumption based on low activity
    if current_activity in ('Stand', 'Sit'):
        if (activity is stable and quiet)
            activity_durations['Early morning'] += (timestamp_next - timestamp_current)
    
    # Sandwich time is harder to define
```

### Data Analysis Results (dummy results):
Assuming there are indeed entries as described, your final results might look like:
- Relaxing: X seconds
- Coffee Time: Y seconds
- Early Morning: Z seconds
- Cleanup: A seconds
- Sandwich Time: B seconds

Thus, to articulate this well, you will process events into a usable format like above and summarize accordingly. The activity names may be distributed over time based on inferred behaviors, and totals should act proportionally to observed events.

### Note:
To properly summarize this data precisely, actual computation with the dataset should be undertaken using a programming method as outlined, and actual activities would need to be ascertained from how well they match the inferred definitions of each activity.
