### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity in the provided CSV data, we'll follow these general steps:

1. **Extract timestamps** and corresponding activity labels from the CSV data.
2. **Identify the start and end times** of each activity by iterating through the timestamped data.
3. **Calculate the duration** for each unique activity by subtracting the start time from the end time.

Let's walk through the CSV data and calculate the durations explicitly for the activities: "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," and "Sandwich time."

The activity labels were not explicitly included in the CSV data, but we can infer based on standard activities. Hereâ€™s the identified mapping of activities to potential names based on common themes:

- "Sit" might be associated with "Relaxing."
- "Drink from Cup" might relate to "Coffee time."
- "Clean Table" might relate to "Cleanup."
- "Eat" might relate to "Sandwich time," if it were mentioned, but there is no explicit mention of eating a sandwich in the provided data.
- "Stand" or "Walk" does not directly correspond to any of the labeled activities.

Given the absence of direct labels for "Early morning," we will assume it could refer to activities done in the early portions of the data.

Now, here's a streamlined process to calculate the durations. We'll analyze each identified activity and collate their timestamps.

### Gathering Data

1. **Relaxing:** Time spent sitting (Sit).
2. **Coffee time:** Instances of drinking from a cup.
3. **Cleanup:** Instances of cleaning the table.
4. **Early morning:** Occurrences of earlier activities before any specific labels.
5. **Sandwich time:** Not directly present in data.

### Processing the Data

Let's tabulate the identified activities and their durations. For the specifics:

- **Relaxing:**
  - "Sit" from 272-315, 398-404, 675-678, 711-874, 896-905, 1365-1373, 1406-1410, 1481-1485.
- **Coffee time:**
  - "Drink from Cup": 850-851, 851-855, 994-994, 1007-1007, 1401-1401.
- **Cleanup:**
  - "Clean Table": 1440-1451, 1451-1452.
- **Early morning:** 
  - May encompass timestamps from the very beginning, specifically times before sitting or engaging in multiple walks.
  
### Calculated Durations:
Here are the calculated durations for each associated activity:

- **Relaxing (Total time counting Sit durations):**
  - From 272 to 315: 43 seconds
  - From 398 to 404: 6 seconds
  - From 675 to 678: 3 seconds
  - From 711 to 874: 163 seconds
  - From 896 to 905: 9 seconds
  - From 1365 to 1373: 8 seconds
  - From 1406 to 1410: 4 seconds
  - From 1481 to 1485: 4 seconds
  - Total Relaxing Duration = 43 + 6 + 3 + 163 + 9 + 8 + 4 + 4 = **240 seconds** (or 4 minutes).

- **Coffee time (Total time counting Drink from Cup):**
  - From 850 to 855: 5 seconds
  - From 994 to 994: 0 seconds
  - From 1007 to 1007: 0 seconds
  - From 1401 to 1401: 0 seconds
  - Total Coffee Time Duration = 5 seconds.

- **Cleanup (Total time counting Clean Table):**
  - From 1440 to 1451: 11 seconds
  - From 1451 to 1452: 1 second
  - Total Cleanup Duration = 11 + 1 = **12 seconds**.

- **Early morning**: Unable to define a precise duration without its explicit activities.

**Summary of Durations:**

| Activity       | Duration (seconds) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Relaxing       | 240                 |
| Coffee time    | 5                   |
| Cleanup        | 12                  |
| Early morning   | TBD                 |
| Sandwich time   | Not present         |
