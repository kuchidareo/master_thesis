### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity, we'll have to identify the periods during which each activity occurs based on the timestamps provided. However, the activity labels like "Relaxing", "Coffee time", "Early morning", "Cleanup", and "Sandwich time" are not explicitly marked in the dataset. Instead, we'll have to deduce them from patterns in sensor activities.

Here is a possible interpretation and estimation of durations based on typical daily routines and the sensor data provided:

1. **Relaxing**:
   - Typically involves sitting or standing still without much activity.
   - The pattern observed between some Sit and Stand entries with large idle gaps or simple Stand-Sit transitions could hint at relaxing.

2. **Coffee time**:
   - Often involves drinking from a cup or getting something from the kitchen (such as a fridge or a drawer).
   - Series of actions involving "Drink from Cup" or activities centered around the "Open Fridge" or "Close Fridge" along with Walks and Stands can be interpreted for coffee time.

3. **Early morning**:
   - This could start from the first activity recorded and continue until a noticeable shift in activity type occurs.
   - Initial sequences of Walk and Stand then Sit might suggest an early morning pattern.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Would involve a sequence of activities like opening and closing drawers or dishwashers typically.
   - Actions such as "Close Dishwasher", repeated opening/closing of drawers, and other similar activities can be considered cleanup.

5. **Sandwich time**:
   - Similar to coffee time, it could involve kitchen-centric activities but focused more on food preparation like opening the fridge and using drawers, with less emphasis on "Drink from Cup".

Based on this interpretation, here's a rough estimation of each activity's duration by observing the sequences in the provided data:

1. **Relaxing** - Periods with consecutive Sit, Stand, and occasional Walk with no associated action (e.g., and lengthy Sit period):
   - Example: From timestamp 272 (Sit) to timestamp 366 (Open Door 1,Walk) may suggest relaxation.
   - Additional periods found through similar pattern analysis.

2. **Coffee time** - Observing entries with "Drink from Cup":
   - Example: From timestamp 843 (Drink from Cup,Stand) to timestamp 885 (Sit).

3. **Early Morning** - Typically starting from the earliest recorded activity:
   - Example: From timestamp 92 (Walk) to timestamp 272 (Sit) as initial morning routines.

4. **Cleanup** - Series of drawer or dishwasher activities:
   - Example: Cleanup observation around Close Drawer/Dishwasher transactions, such as from timestamp 700 (Close Drawer 2, Stand) to timestamp 733 (Close Fridge, Stand).

5. **Sandwich time** - Observing food-related actions around fridge and drawer without a "Drink from Cup":
   - Example: Around timestamp 1043 (Open Fridge,Walk) to timestamp 1066 (Close Drawer 2, Walk).

With the large dataset, to automate this process effectively, you would create conditions that match typical patterns using some machine learning or logic-based/conditional parsing scripts to identify these sub-periods programmatically. This is a sketch of a potential manual analysis/computation.
