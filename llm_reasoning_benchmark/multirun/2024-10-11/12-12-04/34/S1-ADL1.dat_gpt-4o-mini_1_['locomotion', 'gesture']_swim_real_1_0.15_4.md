### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) based on the CSV data provided, we first need to clarify the meanings of each activity label and identify any occurrences of these activities within the data. 

From the provided data, we need to locate the timestamps where each activity is initiated and when it is switched to another activity or remains inactive. However, none of the specified activity labels (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) seem to be directly mentioned in the dataset.

Based on the terminology present in the dataset, we can derive the following potential correlations:

- **Relaxing** might be represented by the `Sit` activity.
- **Coffee time** could be encompassed by instances of `Drink from Cup` along with `Sit` and `Stand`.
- **Early morning** might not have a clear representation, unless we consider early activities in the timestamps.
- **Cleanup** is likely represented by `Clean Table` and related activities.
- **Sandwich time** is not specifically noted in the data provided.

### Steps to Analyze the Data:

1. **Identify All Relevant Timestamps:**
   For each activity, we need to take note of the timestamps when the relevant activities start and end.

2. **Calculate Duration:**
   The duration for each activity can be calculated as the difference between the start and end timestamps.

### Calculation of Activity Durations:

#### 1. Identify and calculate the duration for `Sit` (i.e., potential Relaxing):

- Let's extract the relevant timestamps:
    - `Sit`: begins at 675 and 862, for example.
    
    To clarify:
    ```
    Sit: 675 (start) - followed by a period of Stand, then followed by another Sit at 862.
    ```
    This implies that the duration from the first Sit to the next inactivity (i.e., not switching to Stand) would be the difference in timestamps where the events change.

#### 2. Identify `Drink from Cup` (i.e., potential Coffee time):

- Timestamps to note:
   - `Drink from Cup` appears multiple times; each appears to start and stops within alternating activities:
   ```
   Timeframes are:
   843 (Stand) to the next activity; calculate each of these switches.
   ```
   
#### 3. Identify `Clean Table` (i.e., Cleanup):

- Example timestamps could be found by:
   - `Clean Table`: appears at 1440, 1451 and the activities around this timeframe indicating active work around cleaning.

### Example Calculation Steps:

1. **For Relaxing (`Sit`)**:
   - Sit begins at 675.
   - The activity ends prior to the next significant activity (potentially at 683, but followed by duration of Walk).
   - **Duration for Sit**: End timestamp of inactive (or another switching event).
  
2. **For Coffee Time (`Drink from Cup`)**:
   - Activity starts at 843 and actively switches (to either `Stand`, `Walk`).
   - Calculate duration by time differences until next completely different activity occurs.

3. **For Cleanup (`Clean Table`)**:
   - Start at 1440 with the next change happening at 1460.
   - **Cleanup Duration = 1460 - 1440 = 20s**.

### Conclusion:

To finalize these activations into a table for summarization, you would essentially extract the start, stop, and compute these durations. Without exact log identifiers for all activities, noting, and iteratively applying the duration logic will be necessary, focusing closely on transition data points. 

Finally, this pattern recognition and duration calculation will yield better insights into the frequency and duration for each specified human activity label.
