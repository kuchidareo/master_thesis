### assistant
To calculate the duration of each labeled activity, we first need to examine the CSV data to see where these activities begin and end. Here's an analysis to determine the duration of each activity:

1. **Relaxing**: 
   - This typically involves activities like sitting or lying down without interruption.
   - Observing timestamps 628–673, 885–889, 1109–1311, and 1383–1419 appear to reflect relaxing, with long stretches of sitting or lying without much interruption.
   - Combined duration: \( (673 - 628) + (889 - 885) + (1311 - 1109) + (1419 - 1383) = 45 + 4 + 202 + 36 = 287 \) units.

2. **Coffee time**: 
   - This is often characterized by activities like "Drink from Cup".
   - Observations at 699–705, 843–851, 855–876, and 1337–1338 seem to align with this label.
   - Combined duration: \( (705 - 699) + (851 - 843) + (876 - 855) + (1338 - 1337) = 6 + 8 + 21 + 1 = 36 \) units.

3. **Early morning**: 
   - Could involve activities consistent with the start of the day, but without specific context, exact identification is harder.
   - Analysis shows continuous minor movements that might fit this category at 0–443. This could depict getting up in the morning, preparing, etc.
   - Combined duration: \( 443 - 0 = 443 \) units.

4. **Cleanup**: 
   - They are likely associated with actions such as opening/closing drawers, dishwashers, etc., and cleaning table activities.
   - Observing 702–716, 1046–1067, and other numerous drawer/dishwasher actions scattered suggests such activity.
   - Combined duration: \( (716 - 702) + (1067 - 1046) + \text{Additionals} \approx 14 + 21 + 0 = 35 \) units, without full specifics.

5. **Sandwich time**: 
   - It might involve opening fridge, taking out items, and such sequences.
   - Observing entries like 1040–1051 with fridge interactions hints at this.
   - Combined duration: Approximately \(1051 - 1040 = 11 \) units.

Note: 
- Activity durations can potentially overlap with another if there are interleaving events like a brief action during coffee time.
- "0" entries represent no specific activity label and might be general activity or downtime.
- Events such as "Open/Close Door" and "Toggle Switch" are not inherently categorized into these activities but might align with them through contextual use.
- Accurate determinations rely on understanding what activities precisely belong to events mentioned, i.e., domain-specific labeling.
