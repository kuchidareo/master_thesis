### assistant
To analyze the duration of each activity: Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time, we'll first review the details from the provided sensor data to identify when each activity might have occurred, based on common patterns of actions captured by the sensors.

Let's analyze the data for potential timestamps related to each activity:

1. **Relaxing**:
   - During "Relaxing", a person might spend a considerable amount of time in a sitting or standing idle position, possibly with infrequent movement.
   - Look for extended periods of `Sit` or `Stand` interspersed with minimal `Walk`.

2. **Coffee time**:
   - Activities such as "Drink from Cup" or "Open Fridge" are common during coffee breaks.
   - Note when these events occur and how many times.

3. **Early morning**:
   - This might be indicative of activities occurring at the start of the log such as waking up routines involving, for example, `Open Door` or `Open Fridge`.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Activities like "Close Dishwasher", "Close Drawer", and "Clean Table" may indicate cleaning.
   - Check for sequences of actions involving cabinetry and dishwashing-related events.

5. **Sandwich time**:
   - Likely involves interaction with the "Open Fridge", "Close Fridge", "Open Drawer", and `Sit` activities typical in meal preparation.

### Calculated Durations:
With these assumptions, we compute the duration as follows (all times in seconds):

- **Relaxing**:
  - Major `Sit` positions occur around timestamps like 862-885 and 1411.
  - Total duration: `874-862` + `896-889` + ... ≈ **23 seconds**.

- **Coffee time**:
  - "Drink from Cup" and "Open Fridge" are focal, with timestamps like 851 and 865.
  - Approximate duration around "Drink from Cup" leads us to consider spans in the data.
  - Total duration: Based on evidence near `851-865` ≈ **14 seconds**.

- **Early morning**:
  - Starting activity, possibly first few entries of the log, with "Open Door" and "Open Fridge" actions.
  - Before timestamp 400-500, we notice increasing activity.
  - Total duration: Imagining an early phase before timestamp `500`, prolonged from start.

- **Cleanup**:
  - Actions such as "Close Dishwasher", "Close Drawer", and "Clean Table" occur frequently.
  - Prominent timestamps between 1387-1469 where these actions cluster.
  - Total duration: Considerably, `1440-1426` + `1452-1440` ≈ **26 seconds**.

- **Sandwich time**:
  - Look for preparation activities involving fridge access and sitting.
  - Around `726-747` using "Open Fridge" and `Sit` occurrences.
  - Total duration: `747-726` ≈ **21 seconds**.

In conclusion, by analyzing the action sequence and timestamps provided, these estimated durations may reflect identified routines related to the specified activities. The provided dataset reflects dynamics where sensor notations and transitions provide insights about these guest routines.
