### assistant
To calculate the duration of each of the specified activities, we need to infer when each activity starts and ends. Let's analyze the timestamps and actions to deduce the durations.

1. **Relaxing**: Typically associated with sitting or standing without much interaction with appliances or movement.
2. **Coffee time**: Associated with "Drink from Cup".
3. **Early morning**: Likely involves the first few activities after the day begins, possibly around the initial few timestamps.
4. **Cleanup**: Associated with opening and closing drawers, a dishwasher, or when "Clean Table" appears.
5. **Sandwich time**: Likely involves interactions with the fridge, possibly a sequence involving opening the fridge and closing it shortly after.

### Step-by-step calculation:

#### Relaxing:
Relaxing periods can be inferred during sequences of sitting or standing without interacting much with other objects. Based on this:

- First period: `Stand,673` to `Sit,675` = 2 seconds
- Second period: `Stand,995` to `Sit,1109` = 114 seconds
- Third period: `Stand,1387` to `Sit,1397` = 10 seconds
- Fourth period: `Stand,1419` to `Sit,1419` = 0 seconds (immediate stand to sit)
- Fifth period: `Stand,1439` to `Sit,1448` = 9 seconds
- Sixth period: `Stand,1469` to `Sit,1490` = 21 seconds

Total Relaxing time: \(2 + 114 + 10 + 0 + 9 + 21 = 156\) seconds

#### Coffee time:
Involves "Drink from Cup":

- First period: `Drink from Cup,378` to `Drink from Cup,383` = 5 seconds
- Second period: `Drink from Cup,850` to `Drink from Cup,851` = 1 second
- Third period: `Drink from Cup,855` to `Drink from Cup,876` = 21 seconds
- Fourth period: `Drink from Cup,865` to `Stand,889` = 24 seconds 
- Fifth period: `Drink from Cup,1007` to `Drink from Cup,1401` = 394 seconds
- Sixth period: `Drink from Cup,1401` to `Stand,1419` = 18 seconds    

**Note:** Multiple entries with the same timestamp are considered as part of the same event.

Total Coffee time: \(5 + 1 + 21 + 24 + 394 + 18 = 463\) seconds

#### Early morning:
Assuming it's comprised of initial movements:

- Early morning likely started with `Stand,92` since it begins the record, till some event indicating a routine like `Drink from Cup,378`.
  
Total Early morning time: From `Stand,92` to `Drink from Cup,378`, which means 376 seconds.

#### Cleanup:
Involves drawer, dishwasher interactions or explicit "Clean Table":

- First period: `Close Drawer 2,389` to `Stand,447` = 58 seconds
- Second period: `Close Drawer 3,843` to `Stand,893` = 50 seconds
- Third period : `Drink from Cup,1017` to `Drink from Cup,1401` = 384 seconds
- Fourth period: `Clean Table,1440` to `Stand,1451` = 11 seconds
  
Total Cleanup time:  \(58 + 50 + 384 + 11 = 503\) seconds

#### Sandwich time:
Associated with fridge interactions owing to opening and closing:

- First period: `Open Fridge,336` to `Close Fridge,343` = 7 seconds
- Second period: `Open Fridge,723` to `Close Fridge,733` = 10 seconds
- Third period: `Open Fridge,1043` to `Close Fridge,1047` = 4 seconds
- Fourth period: `Open Fridge,1313` to `Close Fridge,1328` = 15 seconds
  
Total Sandwich time: \(7 + 10 + 4 + 15 = 36\) seconds

Given our assumptions, here are the durations for each activity:
- Relaxing: 156 seconds
- Coffee time: 463 seconds
- Early morning: 376 seconds
- Cleanup: 503 seconds
- Sandwich time: 36 seconds
