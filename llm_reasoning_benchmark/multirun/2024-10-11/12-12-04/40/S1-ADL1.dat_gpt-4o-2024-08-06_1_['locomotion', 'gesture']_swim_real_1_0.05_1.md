### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specific activity based on the provided sensor data, we first need to identify the relevant timestamps for each activity and compute the differences between their start and end times. I'll outline the process for each activity:

### Relaxing
Relaxing typically includes activities like "Lie" and moments of prolonged "Stand" without significant movement or other interactions. Based on the sensor labels:

- The user lies down from `1504` and before `Walk` at `1522`.
- Duration of first "Lie": 1522 - 1504 = 18 seconds.

However, to include other "relaxing" moments correctly, an accurate context from timestamps and other narratives is generally needed, which cannot fully be deduced only from this list.

### Coffee Time
This may correlate with actions like "Drink from Cup". For those:

- Drinking events occur at intervals: `843 to 874` and `865 to 885`.
- Calculating these segments:
  - First drink segment: `885 - 865 = 20 seconds`
  - The timestamps suggest ongoing activity within a wider context (`843, 876,` etc.), assuming a possible continuous block within gaps, though:
    - Total observed: `885 - 843 = 42 seconds`.

### Early Morning
There's mention of an "Early Morning," likely inferred from the initial part of the dataset:
- No explicit continuous "early morning" label without specific timestamps suggestive of this.
- Thus, it requires external context (day start hours).

### Cleanup
Includes "Clean Table" and similar actions:
- "Clean Table" occurs from `1440 to 1452`.
- Duration: `1452 - 1440 = 12 seconds`.

### Sandwich Time
Given the actions around the kitchen:
- Assumed time involves fridge operations.
- Considers actions from initial fridge open (stand from `1046`) until sit or unrelated task (`1043 to 1109`):
  - Segments may include opening drawers, fridge, and dishwasher activities generally coinciding with meal prep.
  - Delimits: actual food-specific action (such as "Drink from Cup" for coffee) needs explicit marks to segregate ordinary standing "prep" vs non-specific.

These are approximations given constraints in clear activity labeling/data segments:
- Changes, code specifics, kitchen appliance interactions as approximate points denoting categories rather than explicit contexts. Real-world pragmatics of such mappings require additional semantic/full events correlation.
