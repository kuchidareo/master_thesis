### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time) from the given sensor data, we will need to look for specific sequences of activities that correspond to the labels provided. 

Let's assume the following mappings for the activities based on common scenarios:

1. **Relaxing**: This can be inferred from sequences involving "Sit" or "Lie" without significant interruptions.
2. **Coffee Time**: This activity may involve actions associated with coffee preparation, like "Drink from Cup".
3. **Early Morning**: This might be characterized by morning-oriented activities such as "Open Fridge," or "Walk" shortly after waking up, often occurring shortly after a "Sit" or "Lie".
4. **Cleanup**: This can be indicated by activities like "Clean Table," or actions involving closing doors and drawers consistently as part of tidying up.
5. **Sandwich Time**: Activities involving "Drink from Cup" can hint at this if they're part of a lunch-oriented time or associated with other lunchtime activities.

### Step-by-step Analysis

To do this efficiently, I will get the timestamps corresponding to each activity and calculate the durations based on differences between start and end times for relevant activities.

#### Data Segmentation

1. **Relaxing**: Let's extract timeframes where "Sit" is mentioned multiple times without significant disruptive events like "Walk".
2. **Coffee Time**: Look for timestamps related to "Drink from Cup" events.
3. **Early Morning**: Check timeframes just after possible waking instances like a prolonged "Sit" or "Stand". 
4. **Cleanup**: Look for "Clean Table" and pairing actions of "Close Drawer" or "Close Dishwasher".
5. **Sandwich Time**: Identify patterns similar to Coffee but check for other eating-related actions.

### Activity Analysis

Let's look at some possible time slots identified from the dataset and group them where appropriate.

#### Example Calculations for Each Activity
1. **Relaxing**
   - From timestamps 673 to 900 where "Sit" is predominant, leading to a duration:
   - Duration: 900 - 673 = 227 seconds

2. **Coffee Time**
   - From timestamps involving "Drink from Cup" at 850, 851; adding related timestamps as appropriate:
   - Approximate duration starts from the coffee-making process leading to these drink instances up to that point if earlier actions align.
   - If duration is considered single drink: 851 - 850 = 1 second (but typically you'd segment across surrounding context).

3. **Early Morning**
   - Start observing any 'Sit' or 'Walk' after significant inactivity indicating waking up, possibly from before timestamp 1000 till 1063 post few walks.
   - Approximate potential segment from early parts: e.g., 336 - 911 would add as segments.

4. **Cleanup**
   - Utilizing "Clean Table" at 1440 and 1451, add timings leading from other cleanup actions simplifying states before to estimate cleanup; e.g., might include pre-clean actions.
   - Differquiring sections leading up to these actions could yield durations.

5. **Sandwich Time**
   - Drink from coffee and adjacent possible meal actions for windowed sections would get estimates, notably if timestamped distinctly around meal time contexts.

### Final Summary
For summarizing, all above results should lead to tabulation like so:

| Activity      | Total Duration (seconds) |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Relaxing      | 227                     |
| Coffee Time   | Approximately 2+ (1 sec by drink but cumulative) |
| Early Morning | Variable based on inferred sequences |
| Cleanup       | Cumulatively estimate based off identified cleanup tasks |
| Sandwich Time | Requires more activity context |

You would refine this analysis based on a more extensive context application through segmented filtering of activity overlaps or matches for a descriptive report. 

Adjust calculations based on further contextual definitions of timeframes or if we had temporal boundaries set.
