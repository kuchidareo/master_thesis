### assistant
To determine the duration for each activity, we need to identify the start and end moments for each activity, using specific timestamp conditions deduced from the context of the CSV data. The specific activities mentioned — Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time —are not explicitly labeled; we will deduce their periods based on logical groupings of the activities logged.

1. **Identifying Activities:**

   - **Relaxing:** Could be associated with lying down or sitting without significant interruptions.
   - **Coffee Time:** Likely involves "Drink from Cup" events.
   - **Early Morning:** Could correlate with events that typically occur right after waking up, which might be in the earliest time stamps (but this needs contextual background since timestamps here aren't real-time linked).
   - **Cleanup:** Activities related to cleaning or organizing, hinted by actions like "Clean Table."
   - **Sandwich Time:** Might be related to fridge or drawer activities suggesting meal preparation.

2. **Activity Durations Based on Logical Inference:**

Analyzing the timestamps and inferring potential activity types:

- **Relaxing**: 

  Assuming a period of inactivity or low activity in between more active time slots:

  - 0, Lie, 272 to 0, Stand, 302 gives us duration: 302 - 272 = 30
  
  Applicable relaxed sessions could also be inferred between other standing or moving breaks.


- **Coffee Time:** 

   Based on "Drink from Cup" events:
   
   - From 843 to 874 (Drink from Cup), 31
   - From 1401 to 1423 (Drink from Cup, close Drawer), 22

- **Early Morning:** 

  Typically would start with initial actions of the day or the first set of actions after inactivity. This would be speculative but could encompass:

  - Starting with Stand at 92 until visible first action end at Sit 362 for a summation focus (362 - 92 = 270 hypothetically).

- **Cleanup:** 

  Related actions suggesting cleanup due directly to "Clean Table", around the actions:

  - Clean Table starts and spans across frequent actions starting 1440 until 1452, giving a short period of cleanup, 12
  
- **Sandwich Time:** 

  Could be denoted by a sequence involving food preparation actions:

  - Between the blocks where fridge and drawer interactions suggest sandwich ingredients access:
     The fridge activity from 336 to 347 before doors opening, followed by some standing and drawer manipulations can line up for potential for food preparation, yielding periods within each: 11 from 336 to 347, and further engagement actions at subsequent fridge changes.

Thus, durations can be speculated:

- Relaxing: 30
- Coffee Time: 31 + 22 = 53
- Cleanup: 12
- Sandwich Time: (11 + block sequences inferred around fridge/drawer); manually calculating further subsets similar across labels.

Each duration would further need a context or real-timeline basis translating these data points into coherent categorized personal activities. Thus, rational assumptions are drawn out which may overlap, and translations for actual events may vary.
