To calculate the duration of each specified activity, we'll identify the periods in the log where those activities occurred based on sensor events, and calculate their durations.

**Identifying the activities:**

- **Relaxing:** We can assume "Relaxing" involves sitting or lying down with minimal interacting with objects, except maybe "Drink from Cup".

- **Coffee time:** The presence of "Drink from Cup" events with subsequent standing or walking.

- **Early morning, Cleanup, Sandwich time:** These activities don't have explicitly defined sensor events. We will infer them based on typical sequences or patterns involving interaction with the fridge, dishwasher, drawers, etc.

Let's look at each one:

1. **Relaxing:**
   - Sitting starts around timestamp 371.
   - Lying down occurs at timestamp 874.
   - End of relaxing can be inferred from standing or walking.
   - Total Relaxing: Approx from 371-905 (ignoring small standing intervals) and 874-904.
   - Total Duration = (904-371) + (874-1504)(stopping at the last sit/lie).

2. **Coffee time:**
   - Presence of "Drink from Cup" events around 843 and repeated in the timeline.
   - Drink events around timestamps 843-885, 876.
   - Similar interactions repeated at 1401.
   - Total duration would be from 843-885 and 1401-1404 (conservatively, assuming gaps mean breaks in the activity).

3. **Early morning:**
   - This might be inferred as the first periods of activity with notable walking/movement.
   - From the start (early timestamps) up to a pattern shift (inferring from timestamp 0-500 where interactions shift).

4. **Cleanup:**
   - Cleaning actions, such as "Clean Table," occur around timestamp 1440-1451.
   - Prior also has Closing of Dishwasher and Drawers implying enforcing organization.
   - Checking around 1337 to 1489 can give a duration where cleanup, organizing, might happen.

5. **Sandwich time:**
   - Typically involves fridge and some counters or drawers interaction.
   - Fridge interactions with standing and walking around those periods, likely around 1043-1080 and potentially earlier periods like 336-343 for Prep.

**Calculating durations:**

**Relaxing:**
- Duration = (905 - 371) + (874 - 1504) = 534 + 630 = 1164 seconds

**Coffee time:**
- Duration around timestamps:
  - 843 - 885 = 42 seconds
  - 1401 - 1404 = 3 seconds
  - Total = 42 + 3 = 45 seconds.

**Early morning:**
- In general, assumed as the start up to significant interactive or non-sitting activity.
- Say from 0-500 for rough mapping = 500 seconds.

**Cleanup:**
- Time noted from around:
  - 1440 (Cleaning starts) - 1451 (Cleaning ends but includes other activites like standing.
  - Added to multi-drawer/door cleaning.
  - Total cleanup time: Consider 30 + multi intervals before exact door/drawer coefficients refined.

**Sandwich time:**
- Consider fridge timings + primary standing/walking indicating kinetics:
  - 336-343 and 1043-1080 (fridge detailing)
  - Estimations say 120 total seconds

Please note that assumptions taken are close estimates due to indirect timestamps concerning activities with clear events marked in log. More precise interpretations would be impacted by further dataset or definition refinements or alternative pattern observations.
