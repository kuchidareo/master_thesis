### assistant
To calculate the duration of each activity (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to analyze the timestamps and associated activity labels. However, it seems like the specific activities of interest (e.g., Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Sandwich time) are not explicitly listed in the provided sensor data.

Let's go through the data and identify the relevant activities by making the following assumptions based on typical human activities:

1. **Relaxing**: Might be represented by the `Sit` label or prolonged periods where there are no actions (if marked).
2. **Coffee time**: This could be indicated by the `Drink from Cup` actions.
3. **Early morning**: It is planned but specific labels weren't provided, often similar to relaxing or breakfast-related activities.
4. **Cleanup**: Seems to be captured by `Clean Table` or related commands.
5. **Sandwich time**: Not directly mentioned in the data, but might relate to food actions or `Open Fridge`.

With this understanding, let's look for activities within the provided dataset and gather timestamps. Here's how we can systematically record their durations:

### Analyzing Activity Durations:

1. **Relaxing/Sitting**:
   - Activities: `Sit`
   - Timestamps gathered: 
     - Sit at 874, 876, 885, 889, 909, 947, 949, 1109, 1504 (and one entry at 0 for the `Sit` label). 
   - Calculate total duration for `Sit`.
   
2. **Coffee Time**:
   - Activities: `Drink from Cup`
   - Timestamps gathered:
     - Drink at 843, 850, 851, 855, 862, 865, 876 at stand, and last at 1401.
   - Calculate the duration for this set.

3. **Cleanup**:
   - Activities: `Clean Table`
   - Timestamps gathered:
     - Clean Table at 1440, 1451(0, 1451), which implies a continuous action of cleanup.
   - Calculate duration for these timestamps.

4. **Sandwich Time & Early Morning**:
   - As these activities are not specifically labeled, we would need more specific actions reflecting those.

Let's calculate the duration for `Sit`, `Drink from Cup`, and `Clean Table`.

### Calculation Example for Sitting:
For `Sit`:
- Sit at 874 until Stand at 889. Duration: `889 - 874 = 15 seconds`.
- Sit at 947 until Stand at 949. Duration: `949 - 947 = 2 seconds`.
- Sit at 909 until until Stand at 947. Duration: `949 - 909 = 40 seconds`.
- Sit held at certain points until the next activity, summing only clear stretches without interruptions.

### Summary of Expected Results:
After going through enumerated sequences for all related labels, I can consolidate the findings if I had to iterate over the specific timestamps present but as it stands without direct labeling, I recommend further isolating the types of activities to ensure clarity around those present.

Would you like to run specific timestamp values, continue directly with clear cut accumulated timestamps, or visualize this further?
