### assistant
To analyze the CSV data and calculate the duration of each activity—Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time—we first need to define which actions or sensor triggers correspond to these activities. However, the CSV data doesn't directly label activities other than sensor records and actions like `Open Fridge`, `Close Fridge`, etc. 

One way to approach this problem is by correlating specific sequences or groups of actions to activities. I will assume possible common interpretations for each activity based on typical human daily routines:

1. **Relaxing**: Could involve actions like lying, sitting for an extended (and uninterrupted) period.
2. **Coffee time**: Could involve sequences that include `Drink from Cup` action.
3. **Early Morning**: Might be inferred from first activities post certain timestamp at the beginning of the data (assuming the data is chronologically sorted).
4. **Cleanup**: Typically correlates with actions such as `Clean Table`, `Close Dishwasher`, and movements around.
5. **Sandwich time**: Could involve `Open Fridge`, `Close Fridge`, and movements that could resemble preparing food.

Based on this conceptual understanding, here are rough estimates and how such calculations would be derived:

### Analyzing Time Intervals:

- **Relaxing**: Consider intervals where the state is predominantly `Lie` or prolonged `Sit`.
   - From `0,Lie,272` to `0,Stand,319`: 47 units
   - After `Drink from Cup,Sit,876` to `0,Stand,889`: 13 units
   - There was a `Drink from Cup` activity at `876` and sitting post it till `885`, could be linked back to Relaxing if we're considering the post-coffee relaxation.
   - Finally, a significant relaxing period was from `0,Lie,1504` till time's end `0,Walk,1522`: 18 units. However, walking indicates ending of relaxing period.

- **Coffee time**: When the user is interacting with anything labeled 'Drink from Cup'.
   - Sequence found around `Drink from Cup` from `843` to `885`, about 42 units total, then sitting indicates post-coffee relaxation.

- **Early Morning**: Assuming this period is the initial activity sequence, let's say first notable activity post initial timestamps.
   - This information would typically require an external confirmation since the excerpt starts at `92`. If considering actions with opening fridge indicating breakfast, initial curious activity involves:
     - Early activities can be from `Open Fridge,Walk,336` to `Close Fridge,Stand,343`: About 7 units

- **Cleanup**: Identified with sequential operations considered tidying:
   - From `Clean Table,Walk,1440` to `Clean Table,Stand,1451`: 11 units

- **Sandwich time**: Involves fridge actions and walk, mingling actions:
   - Actions focused around `Open Fridge` to `Close Fridge`, found sequences:
     - `Open Fridge,Walk,336` to `Close Fridge,Stand,343`: 7 units
     - Another intensive around `Open Fridge,Stand,723` to `Close Fridge,Stand,733`: 10 units
     - Later, `Open Fridge,Stand,1314` to `Close Fridge,Stand,1326`: 12 units
   
Note: Assumptions such as timestamps being incremental (interpreted mills), complex multi-tasking, and lack of explicit blocks mean approximations may vary. For more accuracy, human judgment in domain-specific context filling would be necessary.
