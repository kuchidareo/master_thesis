To calculate the duration of each activity, we'll need to find where the activities Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time occur in the provided data. 

1. **Relaxing**: This can often be associated with states where the person might be **Sitting** or **Lying** down for continuous periods.
2. **Coffee time**: This can be associated with repetitive **Drink from Cup** events.
3. **Early morning**: Common morning activities might involve a sequence of waking up associated motions. In this dataset, we might assume it begins early but it's unclear without specific events.
4. **Cleanup**: Activities like "Clean Table" might relate directly to this.
5. **Sandwich time**: This can be inferred from fridge access followed by other activities that might involve using the counter or eating.

Let's create a simple analysis:

- **Relaxing**: 
  - Start: 992 Lie at timestamp 992
  - End: 996 when standing starts (rounded to nearest relevant labeling)
  - Relaxing duration: 996 - 992 = 4 units of time

- **Coffee time**:
  - Notable timestamps we see "Drink from Cup":
    - Start: 843 Drink from Cup, Stand at timestamp 843
    - End: 885 when Sit ends at 885
    - Coffee time duration: 885 - 843 = 42 units of time
  
- **Early morning**:
  - Assumption based on initial activity: Start around initial actions and fridge operations.
  - Starts: around 0
  - Until some change or break in the pattern of activity, might contain the movable window until things peak to a regular later hourly change: close door activities cluster at 1423
  - Early morning duration: It's too ambiguous to identify without clear labels from the data you provided.

- **Cleanup**:
  - Start: 1440 Clean Table
  - End: 1452 End clean-related actions
  - Cleanup duration: 1452 - 1440 = 12 units of time

- **Sandwich time**:
  - Based on accessing the fridge and subsequent kitchen-related activities.
  - Start: 1043 Access to fridge
  - Consider activities around 1407 with the closing of drawers likely indicating preparing something with use.
  - Sandwich time duration: Duration isn't cleanly defined without more granular events surrounding food prep, but spans interrelated to the inferred points.

Since we can only assume based on contextless labels and dependencies on actions as specified, durations are found by identifying relevant activity groupings, but no sharp activity calendar exists with explicit markers without better defined metadata.
