### assistant
To calculate the duration of each labeled activity, we first need to analyze the sequence of timestamps to identify the activities and their corresponding duration based on the provided timestamps from the CSV file.

### Activities Description and Analysis:
From the CSV file, there are several labeled activities related to human actions:

1. **Relaxing**: This would likely correspond to durations where the person is in states like "Lie" without transitions.
2. **Coffee time**: This involves activities such as "Drink from Cup".
3. **Early morning**: This may relate to an initial sequence of activities at the start of the sequence, perhaps involving the first transitions from "Lie" to "Walk" and other such morning activities.
4. **Cleanup**: This is associated with "Clean Table" and possibly other cleaning-related actions like handling the dishwasher or drawers.
5. **Sandwich time**: This likely involves sequences where food-related actions occur, like using the fridge or drawers, without explicit sandwich mentions.

### Calculating Durations:

- **Relaxing**:
  - Based on the sequence, "Lie" starts at timestamp `272` and the first available transition to a different activity (here, a walk) is at `315`. Duration = `315 - 272 = 43` units.

- **Coffee time**:
  - "Drink from Cup" activities occur at:
    - `843` to `862` (changed to Sit -> End at `874`). Duration = `19` units.
    - `865` to `885` during Sit. Duration = `20` units.
  - Total = `19 + 20 = 39` units.

- **Early morning** may only be identifiable if defined activities (like the "beginning of significant interactions") are pinpointed:
  - After analyzing timestamps, assume early morning to end after the first fridge interaction and associated activities after waking.
  - Assume ends around first stand after active engagements (like opening drawers), potentially at `678`.
  - Beginning to `678 - 272`. Early morning: `406` units.

- **Cleanup:**
  - "Clean Table" events occur at:
    - `1440` to `1451` and ending `1451`. Duration = `11` units.

- **Sandwich time**:
  - Since no "sandwich" tag exists, use food-related activities (using the fridge and drawers in a sequence):
  - Identify a pattern that seems like assembling food: eg. fridge and drawer sequence at `1043` to `1051` during "Walk" and initial steps for preparing items.
  - Potentially: Another pattern starts at `993` with drawer and fridge usage.
  - Sum durations with a reasonable assumption of `10` unit duration around these clusters, approximating sandwich making.

### Summary:
- **Relaxing**: `43` units.
- **Coffee time**: `39` units.
- **Early morning**: `406` units.
- **Cleanup**: `11` units.
- **Sandwich time**: Let's hypothesize approximately `20` units based on cluster analysis.

These calculations hinge on some assumptions and temporal inference based on the timestamp data available. The duration units aren't specified (could be seconds, minutes, etc.), impacting how these numbers are interpreted in real-time.
