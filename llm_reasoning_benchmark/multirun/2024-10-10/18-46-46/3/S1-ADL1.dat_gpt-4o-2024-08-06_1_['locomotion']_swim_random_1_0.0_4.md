### assistant
To analyze the durations of specific activities captured from the sensor data, we need to identify segments of the data linked to these activities. The activities of interest are:

- **Relaxing**: This might correspond to periods marked by the "Lie" label.
- **Coffee Time**: Periods involving drinking from a cup or involving kitchen activities.
- **Early Morning**: Likely the activities early in the log if claimed by your context.
- **Cleanup**: Activities involving "Drawer" and possibly "Dishwasher".
- **Sandwich Time**: Activities involving "Fridge" and "Drawer" for a sandwich preparation context.

We'll extract the durations for each activity based on the assumption above, considering that contiguous entries are part of that activity.

### 1. Relaxing (Lie):
- From timestamp **272** to **302** (Lie to Stand).
  - Duration = 302 - 272 = 30.

### 2. Coffee Time (Drink from Cup):
- From **843** to **862** (Stand to Sit).
  - Duration = 862 - 843 = 19.
- From **865** to **874** (Sit to Sit).
  - Duration = 874 - 865 = 9.
- From **876** to **885** (Sit to Stand).
  - Duration = 885 - 876 = 9.
- Total Duration = 19 + 9 + 9 = **37**.

### 3. Early Morning:
- This isn't strictly marked by an explicit label in the data, but we could consider the early activity sequence if it signifies morning setup or waking routines.
- For the sake of this, we will stop at the first stated activity relevant time which is opening the fridge:
  - From **0** to **336** ("Open Fridge" at 336).
  - Duration = 336 - 0 = **336**.

### 4. Cleanup (Clean Table):
- Based on the "Clean Table" label:
- From **1440** to **1451** (Stand to Stand with Clean Table in between).
  - Duration = 1451 - 1440 = **11**.

### 5. Sandwich Time:
- Based on opening the fridge and involving drawers as a potential sandwich-making setup:
- An arbitrary chosen sandwich-making sequence like opening fridge, using drawer which appears multiple times.
  - For instance, from **723** (Open Fridge) to **735** (Stand after fridge operations).
  - Then a larger set from **1043** (Open Fridge) to **1073** (end in another walk or stand).
    - Segment 1 (723-735) becomes: 735 - 723 = 12
    - Segment 2 (1043-1073) becomes: 1073 - 1043 = 30
  - Total Duration = 12 + 30 = **42**.

All durations are in whatever time unit the timestamps are recorded (most likely seconds). Depending on the real scenarios or data logging methodology, interpretations might differ slightly.
