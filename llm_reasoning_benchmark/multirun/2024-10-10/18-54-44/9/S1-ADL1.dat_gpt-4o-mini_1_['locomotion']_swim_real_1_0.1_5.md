### assistant
To calculate the duration of each of the mentioned activities (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we need to identify the timestamps associated with each activity in the provided CSV data.

However, based on the provided data, the specific activities you mentioned do not appear to be labeled directly in the sensor data. Instead, we see general actions like "Sit", "Stand", and "Walk", as well as some specific tasks like "Clean Table", "Open Door", "Close Drawer", etc.  Thus, we will need to interpret these actions to some degree, assuming common activities based on human behavior:

1. **Relaxing:** This can be interpreted as "Sit" where no active walking around is happening for a significant duration.
2. **Coffee time:** This may align with instances where "Drink from Cup" is observed.
3. **Early morning:** This may align with general actions like "Walk" and "Stand" (possibly acting as morning behavior).
4. **Cleanup:** This activity is hinted by "Clean Table" and similar actions.
5. **Sandwich time:** Typically associated with another form of food preparation or similar to coffee time (not directly observed here).

Let's break down the data we can see for durations and summarize them below:

1. **Relaxing (Sit):**
   - Sit from 272 to 302
     - Duration = 302 - 272 = 30
   - Sit from 711 to 714
     - Duration = 714 - 711 = 3
   - Sit from 1025 to 1040
     - Duration = 1040 - 1025 = 15
   - Sit from 1109 to 1110 (approx)
     - Duration = 1110 - 1109 = 1
   - Sit from 1489 to 1504
     - Duration = 1504 - 1489 = 15
   - Total Relaxing Duration = 30 + 3 + 15 + 1 + 15 = 64 seconds

2. **Coffee time (Drink from Cup):**
   - Drink from Cup from 843 to 850 (Walking)
     - Duration = 850 - 843 = 7
   - Drink from Cup from 850 to 851
     - Duration = 851 - 850 = 1
   - Drink from Cup from 855 to 855 (lying)
     - Duration = 855 - 855 = 0
   - Drink from Cup from 865 to 876
     - Duration = 876 - 865 = 11
   - Total Coffee Time Duration = 7 + 1 + 0 + 11 = 19 seconds

3. **Early morning:**
   - This would gather various actions but let's assume the initial actions.
   - Walking can be interpreted from 261 to 315 (significant)
     - Duration = 315 - 261 = 54 seconds
   - Additional actions leading into early behavior for the day would accumulate still in general "walk" or "stand."
   - Estimated Time: General estimate based on seated periods

4. **Cleanup (Clean Table):**
   - Clean Table from 1440 to 1451 (Sitting & Standing)
     - Duration = 1451 - 1440 = 11 seconds
   - Total Cleanup Duration = 11 seconds

5. **Sandwich time:** 
   - No clear markers or behaviors noted within the data that align with this activity.

Now summarizing:

- **Relaxing**: 64 seconds
- **Coffee time**: 19 seconds
- **Early morning**: Approx 54 seconds (initial walk)
- **Cleanup**: 11 seconds
- **Sandwich time**: Not observed

Please note that this analysis relies heavily on assumptions based on common human behavior and may not accurately reflect the intended meanings of each activity label.
