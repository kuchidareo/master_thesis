### assistant
To calculate the duration of each specified activity using the given timestamps, we need to identify the beginning and end of these activities, then compute the time difference. Looking at the list you've provided, it doesn't explicitly label the activities as "Relaxing," "Coffee time," "Early morning," "Cleanup," or "Sandwich time." We have to infer these activities based on the actions and transitions.

Hereâ€™s how we could interpret these activities:

- **Relaxing:** This could be associated with "Sit" or "Lie" activities since they are usually associated with rest.
- **Coffee time:** This might be associated with "Drink from Cup" activities.
- **Early morning:** Could likely be started when the first activity happens.
- **Cleanup:** Associated with "Open Drawer," "Close Drawer," "Clean Table," actions that suggest tidying a space.
- **Sandwich time:** Might be inferred from opening the fridge, walking, and sitting. 

Let's compute durations based on such interpretations:

### Activity Durations

**1. Relaxing:**
- Intervals where the state is "Sit" or "Lie":
  - Sit: 362 to 371 -> 9 seconds
  - Sit: 675 to 685 -> 10 seconds
  - Sit: 747 to 749 -> 2 seconds
  - Sit: 862 to 874 -> 12 seconds
  - Sit: 885 to 889 -> 4 seconds
  - Sit: 1073 to 1077 -> 4 seconds
  - Lie: 1504 to 1522 -> 18 seconds
  - *Total: 59 seconds*

**2. Coffee Time:**
- "Drink from Cup" activities:
  - 843 to 855 -> 12 seconds
  - 865 to 876 -> 11 seconds
  - *Total: 23 seconds*

**3. Early Morning:**
- Starting from the first timestamp to a reasonable guess (let's say before the first "Walk"):
  - 92 to 261 -> 169 seconds

**4. Cleanup:**
- Actions involving drawers, door interactions, and cleaning:
  - Open Drawer 2 (378 to 394) -> 16 seconds
  - Open Drawer 1 (385 to 390) -> 5 seconds
  - Open Drawer 3 (391 to 394) -> 3 seconds
  - Clean Table starts at 1440 and ends when the last clean table action finishes at 1452. -> 12 seconds
  - *Total: 36 seconds* for one round of cleaning/rearranging.
  - Another similar pattern detected: Open Dishwasher at 1337 closes at 1379, involving other drawer operations too. -> 42 seconds

**5. Sandwich Time:**
- Assuming involves fridge, sitting, and walking around:
  - Open Fridge: (336, 343) -> 7 seconds
  - Open Fridge: (907, 909) -> 2 seconds
  - Open Fridge: (1043, 1047) -> 4 seconds
  - Opening Drawer and related activities after Fridge opening events / sandwiches being made related -> 34 seconds
  - *Total sandwich related: 47 seconds* for possible sandwich making across intervals.

These interpretations are "guesstimates" based on action sequences provided in your data. Detailed timestamps might need re-evaluation with context to better define when each label starts and ends precisely. Please adjust based on behavioral context or tighter criteria for activity detection.
