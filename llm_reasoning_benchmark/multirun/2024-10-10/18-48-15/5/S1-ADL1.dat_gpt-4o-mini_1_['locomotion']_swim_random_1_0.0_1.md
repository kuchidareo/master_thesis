### assistant
To analyze the provided data and calculate the durations of the specified activities (Relaxing, Coffee time, Early morning, Cleanup, and Sandwich time), we'll first define an approximate duration for each activity based on the activity labels and their occurrences in the timestamps.

Since the activities are not explicitly spelled out in the data provided, we will assume potential labels based on activity context (e.g., "Drink from Cup" might represent "Coffee time", and "Clean Table" might represent "Cleanup"). We'll analyze the timestamps for these activities:

### Activities of Interest:

1. **Relaxing (could include Sit and Lie activities)**
2. **Coffee time (provided by "Drink from Cup")**
3. **Early morning (may not have a direct representation but could overlap with Coffee time)**
4. **Cleanup (represented by "Clean Table")**
5. **Sandwich time (not explicitly mentioned in the data)**

### Calculating Durations:

1. **Relaxing:**
   - Timestamps for "Sit":
     - Sit at: 862, 865, 874, 876, 885, 889, 897
     - Duration Calculation: 
       - 862 to 885: 23 (Sit)
       - 862 to 889: 27 (Sit)
       - 889 to 897: 8 (Sit)
     - Similar calculations for "Lie":
       - Lie at: 272, 1504
       - Duration from 272 to next non-lie (314): 42
       - Duration from 1504 to end (assumed to be activity switch): Relevant to overall totals.
   - Total time is calculated based on observed spans.

2. **Coffee time:**
   - Timestamps for "Drink from Cup":
     - Drink from Cup at: 843, 850, 851, 855
     - Duration Calculation:
       - 843 to 855: Total of 12 minutes across different timestamps.
   
3. **Cleanup:**
   - Timestamps for "Clean Table":
     - Clean Table at: 1440, 1451
     - Duration Calculation:
       - 1440 to 1451: 11 minutes total.

4. **Sandwich time:**
   - No indicators are present in the provided data.

5. **Early Morning:**
   - Similarly not directly indicated. It may coincide with identified coffee time but needs marked identification in a clearer dataset.

### Summary of Activities Calculated Durations:
- Relaxing: Approx. 37 (time from 'Sit' and 'Lie' but needs excess definition overlay).
- Coffee Time: 12 minutes in two-scan of "Drink from Cup".
- Cleanup: 11 minutes for "Clean Table".
- Sandwich Time: Unmarked.
- Early Morning: Not directly referenced in data.

A complete and accurate analysis would necessitate having times associated definitively with each activity or label in the data to yield final accurate calculations.

If you're looking for a more thorough breakdown in numerical format based on provided timestamps, a detailed collection and cross-reference is required on those individual activity labels if one were to extract better analytics.
